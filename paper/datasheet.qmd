**Motivation**

1.  *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    -   Dataset was created to gauge opinions of close to 50 different sex acts, of varying controversy, using a scale of 0-5 (where 0 is uncontroversial and 5 is extremely taboo).
2.  *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    -   Dataset was created by Aella, unknown if she received assistance but assumed to be independent.
3.  *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    -   Self funded by Aella
4.  *Any other comments?*
    -   No

**Composition**

1.  *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
    -   Instances comprise of people, with each row in the dataset being an individual respondent to the original survey.
2.  *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
    -   One type of instance (people), around 48,000 total instances
3.  *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
    -   All possible instances.
4.  *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
    -   Consists of metadata from Google Forms, a single self-identifier (age), and the question asked (with score given) followed by the associated variable to the question (also with score, making including the original question redundant)
5.  *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   selfage variable, which is the self-identified age of the respondent. Dataset also includes some gendered identifiers, but due to the overwhelmingly cis male responses it loses the characteristic of being an a useful identifier (as most of the responses are from cis males)
6.  *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
    -   Yes, several rows have a significant amount of "NA" or missing values in various spots. No rhyme or reason to them, likely due to "skip question" or similar being chosen in the original form.
7.  *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
    -   No
8.  *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
    -   No
9.  *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   Yes, metadata creates an overwhelming amount of noise. Furthermore, the high proportion of "NA" responses makes some rows redundant.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
    -   Self-contained
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   No
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
    -   Gauges opinion on controversial sex topics, so includes mention of sexual violence and pedophilia
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
    -   Yes, age and gender are self disclosed. Age is distributed mostly in the early 20s to mid 40s but ranges from age 14 to age 100; due to nature of self disclosure it is likely that some of these extreme ages are falsified. Gender is also disclosed, but overwhelming majority of respondents being cis males make data redundant rather than identifiable
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
    -   No
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   Yes, but as the data has no significant personal identifiers the information can be considered anonymous. Data contains sexual orientation information by means of a Yes/No answer to being heterosexual.
16. *Any other comments?*
    -   No

**Collection process**

1.  *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
    -   Data was collected remotely through a Google Form disseminated through the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Answers were inputted into the Google Form.

    -   N/A
4.  *Who was involved in the data collection process (for example, students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (for example, how much were crowdworkers paid)?*
    -   No one, data was collected remotely with no human oversight.
5.  *Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (for example, recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.*

9.  *Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals consented.*
    -   Yes, they consented to having their data collected by responding to the Google Form.
10. *If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).*
    -   No

If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.*
    -   No
