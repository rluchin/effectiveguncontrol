# Analysis of Opinion Poll Data to Explore the Potential Link Between Age and Particular Sexual Acts

**Overview**
This repo contains the code and replication package for an analysis of opinion poll data to explore the potential link between age and opinion of how "taboo" a particular sexual act is percieved.

**Note on Raw Data**
Raw data was collected through opinion polls on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Due to a lack of sample control and authentication of response accuracy, the findings in the project should be interpreted with a grain of salt. Further discussed in section 4 of the paper found in paper/paper.pdf

**Statement on LLM usage**
LLM model GPT4 was used in the creation of code to clean, plot, and graph data. GPT 4 was further used to generate data tests and draft the Introduction and Abstract of this paper, but were heavily modified from the original output. Conversations and links to conversations can be found in other/llm/usage.txt

**Raw Data Acquisition**
Data was collected by X (formerly known as Twitter) influencer Aella, known as @aella_girl on X. Raw data can be acquired from her website at https://knowingless.com/raw-data/
