# Analysis of Opinion Poll Data to Explore the Potential Link Between Age and Particular Sexual Acts

**Overview**
This repo contains the code and replication package for an analysis of opinion poll data to explore the potential link between age and opinion of how "taboo" a particular sexual act is percieved.

**Note on Raw Data**
Raw data was collected through opinion polls on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Due to a lack of sample control and authentication of response accuracy, the findings in the project should be interpreted with a grain of salt. Further discussed in section 4 of the paper found in paper/paper.pdf

**Statement on LLM usage**
LLM model GPT4 and GPT3.5 were used in the creation of code to clean, plot, and graph data. Conversations and links to conversations can be found in other/llm/usage.txt

**Raw Data Acquisition**
Data was collected by X (formerly known as Twitter) influencer Aella, known as @aella_girl on X. Raw data can be acquired from her website at https://knowingless.com/raw-data/
