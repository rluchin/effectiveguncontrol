Take a look at this .csv, how would we go about cleaning it in R?

ChatGPT
To clean a CSV file in R, we typically follow several steps depending on the specific issues present in the dataset. Here’s a general approach:

Read the Data: Load the CSV file into R using read.csv() or readr::read_csv() for better performance and handling.
Inspect the Data:
Use head(), summary(), and str() to get an overview of the data, identify missing values, incorrect data types, and understand the structure.
Clean Missing Values: Depending on the context, you might want to replace missing values with a placeholder (like the mean or median), or you might need to remove rows or columns with too many missing values.
Correct Data Types: Ensure that each column has the correct data type (numeric, character, factor, etc.).
Rename Columns: If the column names are not descriptive or have formatting issues, rename them for clarity and ease of use.
Remove or Filter Outliers: Based on statistical analysis or domain knowledge, identify and handle outliers.
Handle Duplicates: Check for and remove duplicate rows if necessary.
Create New Variables: You might need to derive new variables from existing ones for better insights.
Normalize Data: If required, especially for machine learning applications, normalize or scale the data.
Data Formatting: Address any specific data formatting needs such as date formats.
Since you've uploaded a file, let's start by reading it and examining the first few rows to identify what specific cleaning might be needed. I'll do that now.

Based on the initial inspection of your dataset, here are some key points and suggestions for cleaning:

Mixed Data Types: Some columns are showing mixed data types (e.g., columns 2, 19, 231, 288, 289, 294, 297, 300, 303, 305, 308). You might need to specify correct data types when reading the file or convert them afterwards.
Missing Data: There are a number of missing values in many columns, including the 'Time Finished (UTC)' and various columns towards the end of the dataset. You'll need to decide whether to fill these missing values or drop the columns/rows.
Unnecessary Columns: There appear to be columns that may not be useful for analysis (like 'Randomize' fields), which you could consider dropping.
Renaming Columns: Some column names are excessively long or not descriptive, and renaming them could help make your data manipulation easier.
Normalization/Standardization: If any numerical data are used for analysis, consider scaling or normalizing these.
Here is an example R script demonstrating how you might start cleaning this dataset:

r
Copy code
library(tidyverse)

# Load the data
data <- read_csv("path_to_your_file/taboo-ratings-raw.csv")

# Convert columns to correct data types
data <- data %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))  # Convert all character columns to factors

# Handle missing values
data <- data %>%
  drop_na()  # This removes all rows with any NA values, adjust as necessary

# Rename columns for clarity
data <- rename(data, age = `Your age? (rkkox57)`)  # Example renaming

# Remove unnecessary columns
data <- select(data, -starts_with("Randomize"))  # Removes columns starting with "Randomize"

# Inspecting the data to check the structure and summary
glimpse(data)
summary(data)
You'll need to adjust these steps based on what specific analysis you plan to perform and how these fields are used in your dataset. If you need to perform specific operations or handle particular quirks in your dataset, feel free to ask! ​​

Lets clean the data further. Lets remove the columns "Run", "Program Version", "Time Started", "Time Finished", "Minutes Spent", "Position", "Points", "arousalScale", "Your age?", and any further column that has this structure with a bracketed code: "Which category fits you best? (4790ydl)"
ChatGPT
To clean the data further as per your requirements in R, you can follow these steps:

Remove Specific Columns: Directly remove columns that you mentioned by name.
Remove Columns by Pattern: Identify and remove any columns that have bracketed codes in their names.
Here's how you could write an R script to achieve this:

r
Copy code
library(tidyverse)

# Load the data
data <- read_csv("path_to_your_file/taboo-ratings-raw.csv")

# Remove specific columns
data <- select(data, -c(Run, `Program Version`, `Time Started (UTC)`, `Time Finished (UTC)`,
                        `Minutes Spent`, Position, Points, arousalScale, `Your age? (rkkox57)`))

# Remove columns with bracketed codes in their names
data <- data %>%
  select(-matches("\\(.*\\)"))

# Optionally, inspect the data to ensure the changes
glimpse(data)
This script uses:

select() with -c(...) to explicitly drop the listed columns.
select() with -matches("\\(.*\\)") to drop any column whose name contains parentheses, indicating a pattern you specified (columns with bracketed codes).
This should significantly streamline your dataset, focusing on the columns relevant to your analysis without the additional metadata and structured-named fields you don't need. If you have more specific tasks or another direction for cleaning, just let me know!

User
We also need to save the newly cleaned data as a parquet file
ChatGPT
To save the cleaned data as a Parquet file in R, you'll need to use the arrow package, which supports reading and writing in the Parquet format. Here’s how you can integrate this into your data cleaning and saving process:

Install and load the necessary package:
If you haven't installed the arrow package yet, you can do so using install.packages("arrow").
Perform the cleaning steps as previously discussed.
Write the data to a Parquet file using the write_parquet() function from the arrow package.
Here's the complete script including these steps:

r
Copy code
# Install the arrow package if it's not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("arrow", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("arrow")
}

library(tidyverse)
library(arrow)

# Load the data
data <- read_csv("path_to_your_file/taboo-ratings-raw.csv")

# Clean the data
data <- select(data, -c(Run, `Program Version`, `Time Started (UTC)`, `Time Finished (UTC)`,
                        `Minutes Spent`, Position, Points, arousalScale, `Your age? (rkkox57)`))

# Remove columns with bracketed codes
data <- data %>%
  select(-matches("\\(.*\\)"))

# Save the cleaned data as a Parquet file
write_parquet(data, "path_to_save_your_file/cleaned_data.parquet")

# Optionally, check if the file exists to confirm saving
file.exists("path_to_save_your_file/cleaned_data.parquet")
This script performs the data cleaning and then saves the resulting DataFrame as a Parquet file to the specified path. Adjust "path_to_your_file/" and "path_to_save_your_file/" according to your actual directory structure where the files are located and where you want to save them.

If you need any further customization or have additional requirements, feel free to ask!

How do we open the parquet file?
ChatGPT
To open and read a Parquet file in R, you can use the arrow package, which provides an efficient way to work with Parquet files. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to open a Parquet file in R:

Install the Arrow package: If you haven't already installed the arrow package, you can do so with the following command:
r
Copy code
install.packages("arrow")
Load the Arrow library: Load the library to access its functions.
r
Copy code
library(arrow)
Read the Parquet file: Use the read_parquet() function to read the Parquet file into an R data frame.
r
Copy code
data <- read_parquet("path_to_your_file/cleaned_data.parquet")
Inspect the data: After reading the data, it's often useful to inspect it to ensure everything looks correct.
r
Copy code
head(data)   # View the first few rows of the data frame
Here's the complete script you would use in R:

r
Copy code
# Install Arrow if it's not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("arrow", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("arrow")
}

# Load the Arrow library
library(arrow)

# Read the Parquet file
data <- read_parquet("path_to_your_file/cleaned_data.parquet")

# Inspect the first few rows of the data
head(data)
This script will open the Parquet file located at "path_to_your_file/cleaned_data.parquet" and load it into an R data frame. You can adjust the file path as needed based on where your file is stored. If you encounter any issues or have additional requirements, feel free to ask!

User
We need to clean the data further, lets remove all rows that have "selfage" with a value of NA
ChatGPT
To clean the dataset further by removing all rows that have a missing value (NA) in the "selfage" column, you can use the filter() function from the dplyr package in R. This function allows you to subset rows based on specific conditions. Here’s how you can do it:

Load necessary libraries: If you haven't already loaded dplyr, you should do so, as it provides easy-to-use functions for data manipulation.
Filter the data: Use filter() to exclude rows where "selfage" is NA.
Save the cleaned data: Optionally, you can save the further cleaned data again.
Here's how to integrate these steps in your R script:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(arrow)

# Read the previously cleaned Parquet file
data <- read_parquet("path_to_your_file/cleaned_data.parquet")

# Remove rows where 'selfage' is NA
data_cleaned <- filter(data, !is.na(selfage))

# Optional: Save the further cleaned data to a new Parquet file
write_parquet(data_cleaned, "path_to_save_your_file/further_cleaned_data.parquet")

# Verify the operation by inspecting the first few rows of the cleaned data
head(data_cleaned)
In this script:

!is.na(selfage) is used to keep only rows where "selfage" does not have an NA value.
write_parquet() function is used to save the cleaned data back to a Parquet file if you want to store this cleaned version.
This approach ensures that you have a dataset without missing values in the "selfage" column, allowing for more accurate analysis or modeling without incomplete data issues. If you need more adjustments or have other data cleaning needs, just let me know!

How would we create a simple linear model for this data?
ChatGPT
To create a simple linear model in R using the data you have, you'll need to define a dependent variable (the outcome you are trying to predict) and at least one independent variable (a predictor). Assuming you want to predict one variable based on another, here's a basic guide on how to proceed:

Load Necessary Libraries: Make sure you have the stats package (which is included in base R and contains functions for statistical models) and arrow for handling the Parquet file.
Read the Data: Load your cleaned data from the Parquet file.
Prepare the Data: Ensure that your variables of interest (both dependent and independent) are correctly formatted and free of missing values.
Create the Linear Model: Use the lm() function to specify and fit the model.
Summarize the Model: Use the summary() function to get a detailed summary of the model, which includes coefficients, residuals, and diagnostics such as R-squared and p-values.
Here's how you might implement this in R, assuming you want to predict a variable called outcome based on the variable predictor (you will need to replace these names with those relevant to your dataset):

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(arrow)

# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file
data <- read_parquet("path_to_your_file/further_cleaned_data.parquet")

# Assuming 'outcome' and 'predictor' are the names of your dependent and independent variables
# Ensure that these variables do not contain missing values
data <- na.omit(data, cols = c("outcome", "predictor"))

# Create the linear model
model <- lm(outcome ~ predictor, data = data)

# Summarize the model to view details
summary(model)
This script assumes:

outcome is the dependent variable you're trying to predict.
predictor is the independent variable you're using to predict the outcome.
Both variables are numerical and present in your dataset.
The summary(model) will give you a lot of useful information including:

Coefficients: Estimates of the model parameters, with their significance levels.
Residuals: Summary statistics of the residuals, which can help check assumptions about the model.
R-squared: A measure of how well the model explains the variability of the response data.
F-statistic: A test for the overall significance of the model.
Make sure to check your variables and adjust the model accordingly. If you have specific variables in mind or need further analysis (like diagnostics or checking assumptions), let me know!

User
I mean something like a simple .rds file
ChatGPT
If you'd like to create a simple linear model and save it as an .rds file in R, here's a step-by-step guide to do so:

Read the Data: Assuming you have already cleaned and prepared your data, load it from wherever it's stored.
Fit the Linear Model: Identify your dependent (outcome) variable and an independent (predictor) variable. Fit the linear model using these variables.
Save the Model: Use the saveRDS() function to save your model object to an .rds file, which can be later loaded and used for prediction or further analysis.
Here's a practical implementation of these steps in R:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary library
library(arrow)

# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file
data <- read_parquet("path_to_your_file/further_cleaned_data.parquet")

# Assuming 'outcome' and 'predictor' are the names of your dependent and independent variables
# Make sure to replace 'outcome' and 'predictor' with actual column names in your dataset
# Fit the linear model
model <- lm(outcome ~ predictor, data = data)

# Save the model to an RDS file
saveRDS(model, "path_to_save_your_file/linear_model.rds")

# Optionally, to verify saving, you can load the model back and print a summary
loaded_model <- readRDS("path_to_save_your_file/linear_model.rds")
summary(loaded_model)
Key Points:
lm() function: Used for fitting linear models. It's a powerful tool that models a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
saveRDS(): This function saves R objects in RDS format, which preserves the object's structure and allows it to be reloaded later with readRDS().
readRDS(): Loads an R object saved in RDS format.
Make sure the column names and paths used in the script match those in your dataset and file system. If you need any adjustments or further help with the analysis, just let me know!

User
Based on the .csv of the raw data, what do you believe would be a good model for this data?
ChatGPT
To determine a good model for the data from your CSV file, I'd consider the nature of the data and the specific goals of your analysis. From the initial inspection of your dataset, it seems to involve survey responses with potentially a lot of categorical data, along with some structured response formats and missing data.

Here are a few modeling considerations based on the typical content and goals that might be associated with this kind of data:

1. Nature of Dependent Variable
Continuous vs. Categorical: If the outcome variable is continuous (like a score or a rating), linear regression models are suitable. For categorical outcomes (like group classifications or binary decisions), logistic regression or other classification algorithms might be more appropriate.
2. Purpose of the Model
Prediction vs. Explanation: If the goal is to predict an outcome based on input variables, you might opt for models with better predictive power (like random forests or gradient boosting machines). If the goal is to explain relationships between variables, simpler models like linear or logistic regression could be more suitable, as they provide clearer interpretability.
3. Handling of Categorical Data
Factor Levels: Many variables in your dataset appear to be categorical (potentially with many levels). Models that can naturally handle factor variables (like decision trees or their ensembles) might be more appropriate.
4. Missing Data
Imputation vs. Removal: Depending on the amount and nature of missing data, you might need models that can handle missing values directly, or you might impute missing values before modeling.
Model Suggestions
Based on the general description and typical use-cases for survey data, here are a few modeling approaches you might consider:

Generalized Linear Models (GLM):
Suitable for various distributions of the dependent variable (normal for linear regression, binomial for logistic regression, etc.).
Good for understanding the impact of each predictor while controlling for others.
Tree-Based Models:
Such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting Machines.
Good for handling non-linear relationships and interactions between variables.
Can handle mixed types of data (numerical and categorical).
Factor Analysis or Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
If the goal is to reduce dimensionality or identify underlying factors among many correlated variables.
Cluster Analysis:
If you are interested in identifying distinct groups or segments within your respondents.
Mixed Models:
If your data structure includes hierarchical (nested) data, such as responses nested within demographic groups or locations.
Next Steps
To proceed with building a model:

Define your dependent variable clearly: Decide what you want to predict or explain.
Feature selection and engineering: Based on your knowledge of the subject area, select relevant variables and potentially engineer new features that could be useful for the model.
Deal with missing data: Decide on a strategy for handling missing data.
Model fitting and evaluation: Choose a model based on the criteria above, fit the model, and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics (like RMSE for regression, accuracy/AUC for classification).
If you can specify the target variable and key predictors, or if you describe the specific goals of your analysis, I can provide more tailored advice on setting up the model.

User
I'd like an additional dataset to be created from the cleaned data set. This one will only have two columns, "selfage" and "average", where average is the mean of all the other columns for that specific age
ChatGPT
To create a new dataset from the cleaned data that contains only two columns, "selfage" and "average", where "average" is the mean of all other columns for each specific age, you can follow a specific series of steps in R. This involves filtering, manipulating, and summarizing the data.

Here’s how you can achieve this:

Read the Cleaned Data: Load your previously cleaned dataset.
Select Numeric Columns: Ensure that you're only considering numeric columns for the calculation of the mean, as non-numeric data cannot be averaged.
Calculate the Mean: For each "selfage", calculate the mean of all the other numeric columns.
Create the New Dataset: Create a new dataset that consists of "selfage" and the calculated average.
Here's an R script that demonstrates this process:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file
data <- read_parquet("path_to_your_file/further_cleaned_data.parquet")

# Select only numeric columns (excluding 'selfage' if it's not numeric)
numeric_data <- select(data, where(is.numeric))
selfage_data <- select(data, selfage)

# Calculate the mean of all numeric columns for each 'selfage'
average_data <- numeric_data %>%
  bind_cols(selfage_data) %>%  # Adding 'selfage' back to the dataset
  group_by(selfage) %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), mean, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Select 'selfage' and create a new column 'average' which is the mean of all other numeric columns
final_dataset <- average_data %>%
  transmute(selfage, average = rowMeans(select(., -selfage), na.rm = TRUE))

# Save the new dataset to a new Parquet file
write_parquet(final_dataset, "path_to_save_your_file/age_average_data.parquet")

# Inspect the final dataset
print(final_dataset)
Explanation:
select() is used to isolate numeric columns and the 'selfage' column.
group_by() and summarise() calculate the mean of all numeric columns grouped by 'selfage'.
transmute() is used to transform the dataset to include only the 'selfage' and the new 'average' column.
rowMeans() computes the mean across all numeric columns for each row.
This script assumes 'selfage' is a numeric or factor column and part of the original dataset. If 'selfage' isn't numeric and is instead a factor or character, adjustments might be necessary to handle it properly. The final dataset is saved as a Parquet file, but you could adjust the output format as needed.

If you need further customization or additional analysis, feel free to ask!

New names:Error in `group_by()`:
! Must group by variables found in `.data`.
✖ Column `selfage` is not found.
Backtrace:
 1. ... %>% ungroup()
 5. dplyr:::group_by.data.frame(., selfage)
Error in group_by(., selfage) : 
✖ Column `selfage` is not found.

Error is occuring here:

# Calculate the mean of all numeric columns for each 'selfage'
average_data <- numeric_data %>%
  bind_cols(selfage_data) %>%  # Adding 'selfage' back to the dataset
  group_by(selfage) %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), mean, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
ChatGPT
The error message indicates that the selfage column is not found when attempting to group the data. This can happen if the column selfage was not correctly extracted or bound to the numeric_data dataset.

Let's correct this by ensuring that selfage is appropriately included in the dataset before grouping. Here's how you can adjust the code:

Ensure selfage is correctly included: Verify that selfage is included in the dataset before grouping. If selfage is not part of numeric_data, it must be properly combined.
Check the binding of columns: Make sure selfage is added back correctly and exists in the dataframe before applying the group_by() function.
Here’s the adjusted script:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)

# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file
data <- read_parquet("path_to_your_file/further_cleaned_data.parquet")

# Ensure that 'selfage' is correctly handled if it's not numeric or if it was accidentally excluded
# Select only numeric columns for the average calculation
numeric_data <- select(data, where(is.numeric))

# Ensure 'selfage' is properly included and check its presence
if (!"selfage" %in% colnames(data)) {
  stop("Column 'selfage' does not exist in the dataset")
}

# Extract 'selfage' separately if it's not in numeric_data
selfage_data <- select(data, selfage)

# Combine 'selfage' back with numeric columns
combined_data <- bind_cols(selfage_data, numeric_data)

# Calculate the mean of all numeric columns for each 'selfage'
average_data <- combined_data %>%
  group_by(selfage) %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), mean, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Create a new dataset with 'selfage' and 'average' of other numeric columns
final_dataset <- average_data %>%
  transmute(selfage, average = rowMeans(select(., -selfage), na.rm = TRUE))

# Save the new dataset to a new Parquet file
write_parquet(final_dataset, "path_to_save_your_file/age_average_data.parquet")

# Inspect the final dataset
print(final_dataset)
Key Changes:
Checking for selfage existence: The script now includes a check to make sure the selfage column exists in the data. If it doesn't, the script will stop with an informative message.
Binding columns: bind_cols() is used after ensuring both selfage_data and numeric_data are correctly defined.
Column selection: Before the mean calculation, it ensures that selfage is included with the numeric data.
This revised approach ensures that all necessary data is correctly formatted and included for the grouping and averaging operations. Make sure the column names and dataset paths are correctly specified for your specific setup. If you run into further issues or have additional requirements, let me know!

combined_data creates "selfage 1" and "selfage 2" for some reason
ChatGPT
If the combined_data dataframe is creating duplicate column names like "selfage 1" and "selfage 2", it suggests there may be a selfage column already present in both selfage_data and numeric_data, or an issue with how columns are being combined. This can happen if selfage is accidentally included in both selections or there's a conflict when binding the columns.

Here's how you can resolve this issue:

Ensure selfage is only included once: Explicitly exclude selfage from numeric_data if it's also being separately extracted.
Correctly bind the columns: Bind selfage_data to numeric_data after ensuring that there is no overlap in columns.
Here's the corrected script:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)

# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file
data <- read_parquet("path_to_your_file/further_cleaned_data.parquet")

# Check if 'selfage' exists and is properly formatted
if (!"selfage" %in% colnames(data)) {
  stop("Column 'selfage' does not exist in the dataset")
}

# Extract 'selfage' separately
selfage_data <- select(data, selfage)

# Select only numeric columns for the average calculation, ensuring 'selfage' is excluded if it's numeric
numeric_data <- select(data, where(is.numeric))
if ("selfage" %in% colnames(numeric_data)) {
  numeric_data <- select(numeric_data, -selfage)
}

# Combine 'selfage' back with numeric columns
combined_data <- bind_cols(selfage_data, numeric_data)

# Calculate the mean of all numeric columns for each 'selfage'
average_data <- combined_data %>%
  group_by(selfage) %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), mean, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Create a new dataset with 'selfage' and 'average' of other numeric columns
final_dataset <- average_data %>%
  transmute(selfage, average = rowMeans(select(., -selfage), na.rm = TRUE))

# Save the new dataset to a new Parquet file
write_parquet(final_dataset, "path_to_save_your_file/age_average_data.parquet")

# Inspect the final dataset
print(final_dataset)
Key Adjustments:
Exclusion of selfage from numeric_data: This ensures that selfage is not duplicated in numeric_data if it's accidentally classified as numeric.
Bind Columns Safely: The columns are combined only after making sure that selfage is not duplicated.
This adjustment ensures that selfage appears only once in the combined_data dataframe, thereby avoiding the creation of "selfage 1" and "selfage 2". Make sure that your selfage column is either strictly non-numeric or handled separately from your numeric columns based on this strategy. If further issues arise, let me know!

Lets create a model using this data. I would like a .rds file created that looks at the linear correlation between age and average score
ChatGPT
To create a linear model that explores the correlation between "selfage" and "average score" from your dataset, and then save this model as an .rds file, you can follow these steps using R:

Load the Dataset: Ensure the dataset containing "selfage" and "average" is loaded and ready for analysis.
Fit the Linear Model: Use the lm() function to fit a linear model using "selfage" as the predictor and "average" as the dependent variable.
Save the Model: Use the saveRDS() function to save the fitted model to an .rds file.
Here’s a complete R script that performs these steps:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)

# Read the dataset from the Parquet file
data <- read_parquet("path_to_your_file/age_average_data.parquet")

# Fit the linear model
model <- lm(average ~ selfage, data = data)

# Save the model to an RDS file
saveRDS(model, "path_to_save_your_file/age_average_model.rds")

# Optionally, to verify saving and view a summary of the model
loaded_model <- readRDS("path_to_save_your_file/age_average_model.rds")
summary(loaded_model)
Explanation:
lm(average ~ selfage, data = data): This line fits a linear model predicting "average" from "selfage". The syntax average ~ selfage specifies that "average" is the dependent variable and "selfage" is the independent variable.
saveRDS(): This function saves the model object to an RDS file, which can be reloaded later for further analysis or prediction.
readRDS() and summary(): These lines are used to reload the model and print a summary to check that everything has been correctly saved and the model is as expected.
Make sure to replace "path_to_your_file/age_average_data.parquet" and "path_to_save_your_file/age_average_model.rds" with the actual paths where your files are and where you want to save them.

This approach gives you a simple yet effective linear model that you can use to understand and predict changes in "average" based on "selfage". If you have any modifications, further analysis needs, or encounter any issues, feel free to ask!

ChatGPT
The output you provided is from a linear regression analysis in R using the lm() function. It's detailing the relationship between "selfage" and "average" scores from your dataset. Let's break down each part of the output to understand what it signifies:

Call:
lm(formula = average ~ selfage, data = data): This indicates the formula used to fit the linear model, with "average" as the dependent variable and "selfage" as the independent variable. The data used is referred to as data.
Residuals:
Residuals are the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model. The summary shows:
Min: The minimum residual.
1Q (First Quartile): 25% of the residuals are less than -0.07675.
Median: The median residual, very close to 0, suggesting the model is well-centered around the data.
3Q (Third Quartile): 75% of the residuals are less than 0.09940.
Max: The maximum residual.
The residuals are relatively small, which generally suggests a good fit, but the spread from -0.84331 to 0.64345 might indicate some outliers or model misspecification.
Coefficients:
Coefficients describe the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable.
(Intercept) 2.228589: This is the expected value of "average" when "selfage" is 0. The t-value is 29.34, which is highly significant (p < 2e-16), indicating that the intercept is significantly different from 0.
selfage -0.012126: This is the amount by which "average" decreases for each one-unit increase in "selfage". The negative sign indicates an inverse relationship. The t-value of -8.26 and a p-value of about 1.12e-11 suggest that this slope is significantly different from 0, confirming that age has a statistically significant effect on the average score.
Additional Statistics:
Residual standard error: 0.2476 on 64 degrees of freedom. This gives an idea of the typical size of the residuals.
(1 observation deleted due to missingness): Indicates data cleaning or missing data handling that affected the analysis.
Multiple R-squared: 0.516: This means that approximately 51.6% of the variance in "average" is explained by "selfage". It's a measure of the model's explanatory power.
Adjusted R-squared: 0.5084: This is adjusted for the number of predictors in the model and provides a more accurate measure in the context of multiple predictors.
F-statistic: 68.23 on 1 and 64 DF, p-value: 1.122e-11: This tests whether there is a relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. The very small p-value indicates a statistically significant relationship.
Interpretation:
The model indicates that as "selfage" increases, there is a statistically significant decrease in the "average" score, with all else being held constant. The model seems fairly robust, given the significant F-statistic and reasonable R-squared values, though it might benefit from checking assumptions (like normality of residuals and homoscedasticity) or potentially adding other predictors if more explanatory power is needed.

The error message you're encountering, IOError: Failed to open local file, typically occurs when the file you're trying to write to is already open in another program, or there is a permissions issue preventing access. In this specific case, it seems like a file handle is still open, possibly due to having the file open in another application or an instance of R or Python that hasn't released the file.

Here are several steps to resolve this issue:

Close the File: Ensure that the file taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet is not open in any other applications, including text editors, Excel, or other instances of R or Python.
Check for Background Processes: Sometimes, even if you've closed the file in the visible application, a background process might still be holding onto it. You might need to check your task manager to ensure no processes are still accessing the file.
Restart R Session: Restarting your R session can help clear any lingering handles on files.
File Path Permissions: Make sure that the path you are trying to write to, C:/Users/Russell/Desktop/taboosextopics/data/analysis_data/, is correct and that you have write permissions. Sometimes, permissions can get in the way of writing files, especially in system directories.
Use Absolute Paths: Instead of using relative paths, specify the absolute path in your R script to avoid any confusion about where files are being read from or written to.
Here's an example of how you can modify your R code to include a check or change the file path:

r
Copy code
# Define the file path
file_path <- "C:/Users/Russell/Desktop/taboosextopics/data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet"

# Check if the file is already open and try to close it (R-specific solution, symbolic)
if (file.exists(file_path)) {
  # Attempt to remove any previous version (not generally recommended without user input)
  file.remove(file_path)
}

# Assuming data_cleaned is your dataframe
arrow::write_parquet(data_cleaned, file_path)
This code snippet checks if the file exists and attempts to remove it before writing the new Parquet file. Note that this approach can lead to data loss if not used carefully, so it's usually best suited for automated scripts where you are confident that removing the file is safe.

If the problem persists despite these checks, there might be an issue with file locking by the operating system that could require more specific troubleshooting related to how Windows handles file access and permissions.

Combine these 2 chunks into 1

#| echo: false
#| include: false

# Load the data
data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/taboo-ratings-raw.csv")

# Clean the data
data <- select(data, -c( User, Run, `Program Version`, `Time Started (UTC)`, `Time Finished (UTC)`,
                        `Minutes Spent`, Position, Points, arousalScale, `Your age? (rkkox57)`))

# Remove columns with bracketed codes
data <- data %>%
  select(-matches("\\(.*\\)"))

# Save the cleaned data as a Parquet file
write_parquet(data, "data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

#| echo: false

# Read the previously cleaned Parquet file
data <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Remove rows where 'selfage' is NA
data_cleaned <- filter(data, !is.na(selfage))

# Save the further cleaned data to a new Parquet file
write_parquet(data_cleaned, "data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Verify the operation by inspecting the first few rows of the cleaned data
head(data_cleaned)
ChatGPT
You can combine the two code chunks into one streamlined R script that reads the raw data, processes it, and saves the cleaned version, ensuring that operations are efficient and the script is more maintainable. Here's how you can combine them:

r
Copy code
#| echo: false
#| include: false

# Load the raw data
data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/taboo-ratings-raw.csv")

# Initial cleaning: remove specified columns and columns with bracketed codes
data <- data %>%
  select(-c(User, Run, `Program Version`, `Time Started (UTC)`, `Time Finished (UTC)`,
            `Minutes Spent`, Position, Points, arousalScale, `Your age? (rkkox57)`)) %>%
  select(-matches("\\(.*\\)"))

# Save the intermediate cleaned data as a Parquet file
write_parquet(data, "data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Read the cleaned Parquet file
data <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Further clean data by removing rows where 'selfage' is NA
data_cleaned <- filter(data, !is.na(selfage))

# Overwrite the previously saved Parquet file with the further cleaned data
write_parquet(data_cleaned, "data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Verify the operation by inspecting the first few rows of the cleaned data
head(data_cleaned)
Key Changes:
Combined Operations: The script loads the raw data, performs all necessary cleaning steps in a sequence, and then saves the cleaned data. It then reloads this cleaned data for further processing (removing rows with NA in 'selfage') and saves it again.
Efficiency: By performing all operations in one script without unnecessary reloading of data unless needed (as shown by reloading only to remove rows with NA), it keeps the workflow concise and efficient.
Overwriting the Cleaned File: This script assumes it's safe to overwrite the intermediate cleaned file with the further cleaned data. If this poses a risk of data loss, consider saving different versions of the cleaned files or backup the original cleaned version before overwriting.
This script ensures a clear, sequential data cleaning process, reducing potential errors and maintaining a clean coding environment. If you have specific processing rules or need further modifications, feel free to adjust the script accordingly.

Error: IOError: Failed to open local file 'C:/Users/Russell/Desktop/taboosextopics/data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet'. Detail: [Windows error 1224] The requested operation cannot be performed on a file with a user-mapped section open.
ChatGPT
The error you're experiencing when trying to open the local file taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet indicates that the file is locked or in use by another process. This is a common issue on Windows platforms where files cannot be accessed if they are open elsewhere, including in another program, an IDE like RStudio, or even in a previous run of your R script that hasn't properly released the file handle.

Here are several methods to resolve this issue:

1. Ensure the File is Not Open Elsewhere
Make sure that the file is not open in any other application, including Excel, text editors, or other instances of RStudio.

2. Check for Hidden Processes
Sometimes, a file might still be locked by a background process:

Open the Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc).
Look for processes that might be using the file (e.g., RStudio, R sessions, Python).
If you find any, consider ending these processes if they are not responding or have been left idle.
3. Restart Your Computer
If the file continues to appear locked and you can't identify the specific process using it, a system restart can often clear up the issue by terminating all processes that might be using the file.

4. Use File Unlocker Software
If the file is persistently locked, software tools like "Unlocker" or "LockHunter" can help identify and unlock file handles held by various processes. These tools can show which process is locking the file and allow you to unlock it.

5. Modify the R Script to Handle Files More Carefully
You can modify your R script to check if the file is accessible before trying to write to it. Here's a way to incorporate a check for file accessibility in your script:

r
Copy code
# Define the file path
file_path <- "C:/Users/Russell/Desktop/taboosextopics/data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet"

# Function to check if a file can be accessed
check_access <- function(path) {
  if (file.exists(path)) {
    tryCatch({
      file.rename(path, path)
      TRUE
    }, error = function(e) {
      FALSE
    })
  } else {
    TRUE # File does not exist, should be accessible to create
  }
}

# Attempt to save the file only if it is not locked
if (check_access(file_path)) {
  write_parquet(data_cleaned, file_path)
} else {
  message("The file is currently in use by another process and cannot be written to.")
}

# Proceed with the rest of the script
This script tries to rename the file as a way to check if it's currently locked (renaming will fail if the file is in use). If the file is accessible, it proceeds to save the Parquet file; otherwise, it prints a message indicating the file is in use.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue of the file being locked or in use, allowing your R script to run without interruption. If you continue to experience issues, consider running your script in a clean R session or debugging step-by-step to isolate the exact moment the file gets locked.

Modify this code to only write to the parquet file once

#| echo: false
#| include: false

# Load the raw data
data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/taboo-ratings-raw.csv")

# Initial cleaning: remove specified columns and columns with bracketed codes
data <- data %>%
  select(-c(User, Run, `Program Version`, `Time Started (UTC)`, `Time Finished (UTC)`,
            `Minutes Spent`, Position, Points, arousalScale, `Your age? (rkkox57)`)) %>%
  select(-matches("\\(.*\\)"))

# Save the intermediate cleaned data as a Parquet file
write_parquet(data, "data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Read the cleaned Parquet file
data <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Further clean data by removing rows where 'selfage' is NA
data_cleaned <- filter(data, !is.na(selfage))

# Overwrite the previously saved Parquet file with the further cleaned data
write_parquet(data_cleaned, "data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Verify the operation by inspecting the first few rows of the cleaned data
head(data_cleaned)
ChatGPT
To optimize the code such that it only writes to the Parquet file once, you can combine the cleaning steps and perform a single write operation at the end. This avoids unnecessary reading and writing operations and can significantly speed up your script. Here’s how you can modify the code to achieve this:

r
Copy code
#| echo: false
#| include: false

# Load the raw data
data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/taboo-ratings-raw.csv")

# Initial cleaning: remove specified columns and columns with bracketed codes
data <- data %>%
  select(-c(User, Run, `Program Version`, `Time Started (UTC)`, `Time Finished (UTC)`,
            `Minutes Spent`, Position, Points, arousalScale, `Your age? (rkkox57)`)) %>%
  select(-matches("\\(.*\\)"))

# Further clean data by removing rows where 'selfage' is NA
data_cleaned <- filter(data, !is.na(selfage))

# Save the cleaned data as a Parquet file, only once after all cleaning is done
write_parquet(data_cleaned, "data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Verify the operation by inspecting the first few rows of the cleaned data
head(data_cleaned)
Key Changes and Explanation:
Single Load and Save: The raw data is loaded once, cleaned in a single pipeline, and saved only once after all cleaning steps are completed. This minimizes disk I/O operations, which are typically time-consuming.
Removed Redundant Read: The script no longer reads the intermediate Parquet file because it is unnecessary. All transformations are done in memory, and only the final cleaned data is written to disk.
Streamlined Process: By combining cleaning steps and eliminating the intermediate read/write steps, the process is more efficient and easier to manage.
This modified script is more efficient and should run faster, especially with large datasets, because it reduces the number of read and write operations to the disk. If you encounter any issues with this approach or require further adjustments, feel free to ask!

Use R script to generate me a nice looking table that shows the first 6x6 of the original raw csv
ChatGPT
To generate a nicely formatted table in R that displays the first 6 rows and 6 columns of the original raw CSV file, you can use the kable function from the knitr package, which is excellent for creating Markdown or HTML tables. Here’s how to proceed:

Install and Load Necessary Packages: Ensure you have the knitr and readr (for reading CSV files) packages installed and loaded.
Read the Data: Load your CSV file using read_csv().
Extract the First 6x6 Subset: Select the first 6 rows and columns.
Create the Table: Use kable() to generate a nicely formatted table.
Here’s the R script to accomplish this:

r
Copy code
# Install necessary packages if not already installed
if (!require("knitr")) install.packages("knitr")
if (!require("readr")) install.packages("readr")

# Load the necessary libraries
library(knitr)
library(readr)

# Load the raw data from the CSV file
data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/taboo-ratings-raw.csv")

# Select the first 6 rows and the first 6 columns
data_subset <- data[1:6, 1:6]

# Generate a nice-looking table
kable(data_subset, format = "html", caption = "First 6x6 Subset of Raw Data")
Explanation:
require() is used to check if the package is already installed and load it; if not, it installs the package.
read_csv() reads the CSV file into an R data frame.
Subsetting: [1:6, 1:6] extracts the first 6 rows and columns.
kable() generates a table in HTML format. You can also use format = "markdown" if you prefer Markdown output. The caption argument adds a title to the table.
This script should be run in an R environment capable of rendering HTML or Markdown, such as RStudio or an RMarkdown document. If you’re running this in a plain R script, the output will be plain text, so ensure your environment supports HTML for the best results. If you plan to incorporate this into a report or a presentation, running it in an RMarkdown document would be ideal, as it allows for direct HTML embedding.

User
Now do the first 6x6 of the cleaned parquet
ChatGPT
To generate a table displaying the first 6 rows and 6 columns of the cleaned Parquet file, we'll follow a similar process as before, but this time we'll use the read_parquet function from the arrow package to read the Parquet file. We'll then use the kable function from the knitr package to create the nicely formatted table.

Here's the complete R script for doing this:

r
Copy code
# Install necessary packages if not already installed
if (!require("arrow")) install.packages("arrow")
if (!require("knitr")) install.packages("knitr")

# Load the necessary libraries
library(arrow)
library(knitr)

# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Select the first 6 rows and the first 6 columns
data_subset <- data_cleaned[1:6, 1:6]

# Generate a nice-looking table
kable(data_subset, format = "html", caption = "First 6x6 Subset of Cleaned Data")
Explanation:
require() is used to ensure that the necessary packages are loaded, installing them if they're not already available.
read_parquet() reads the Parquet file into an R data frame.
Subsetting [1:6, 1:6] extracts the first 6 rows and columns from the dataframe.
kable() generates a table in HTML format. This function can format the table as HTML, making it suitable for web pages or R Markdown HTML outputs. The caption provides a descriptive title for the table.
This script is designed to be run in an R environment that can process HTML, like RStudio or within an R Markdown document that outputs to HTML. If you are using an R Markdown document, make sure your output format supports HTML (e.g., by setting the output to html_document in the YAML header). If you encounter any issues or need further customization, feel free to ask!

Generate a line graph for the average data
ChatGPT
To generate a line graph for the average data (assuming you are referring to a dataset where each point represents an average, possibly based on different ages or time points), you can use the ggplot2 package in R, which provides extensive capabilities for creating various types of graphs including line graphs.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to generate a line graph using ggplot2:

Step 1: Install and Load Necessary Packages
Ensure you have ggplot2 and arrow (if your data is still in a Parquet file) installed and loaded.

Step 2: Read the Data
If your data is in a Parquet file, load it; otherwise, ensure it's already in the R environment.

Step 3: Create the Graph
Use ggplot to create a line graph, specifying the variables for the x-axis and y-axis.

Here’s the R script to do this:

r
Copy code
# Install necessary packages if not already installed
if (!require("ggplot2")) install.packages("ggplot2")
if (!require("arrow")) install.packages("arrow")

# Load the necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(arrow)

# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file (if needed)
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Assuming 'data_cleaned' contains columns 'selfage' and 'average' where 'average' is the mean scores for 'selfage'
# Generate a line graph
ggplot(data_cleaned, aes(x = selfage, y = average)) +
  geom_line() +  # This adds the line layer
  geom_point() +  # Optionally add points to the line graph
  labs(title = "Line Graph of Average Data",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Average Score") +
  theme_minimal()  # Optional: Adds a minimal theme
Explanation:
ggplot(data_cleaned, aes(x = selfage, y = average)): This initializes a ggplot object using data_cleaned, mapping selfage to the x-axis and average to the y-axis.
geom_line(): This adds the line element to the plot, connecting data points in the order they appear in the data frame.
geom_point(): Adds points at each data position on the line graph, which can help in identifying individual data points on the graph.
labs(): Used to add labels to the graph, including the title and axis labels.
theme_minimal(): Optional aesthetic improvement using a minimalistic theme.
Make sure the column names and the path to your Parquet file are correct. Adjust the variable names and path according to your actual dataset. This script assumes that your data_cleaned dataframe includes the selfage and average columns. If your data structure or requirements are different, the script will need to be adjusted accordingly. If you need further customization or have other data visualizations in mind, feel free to ask!

Take a look back at the original raw csv. What are 4 ideas, simple enough to graph, that give sufficient analysis to extend past simply being data?
ChatGPT
To generate insightful visualizations from the raw CSV data you provided, I would first consider the nature and structure of the dataset, which appears to involve survey responses related to "taboo" topics. Effective visualizations could help uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, providing more than just an overview but also deeper insights into the underlying phenomena. Here are four ideas for visualizations, each with a specific analytical angle:

1. Distribution of Age Groups
Visualization Type: Histogram or Bar Chart

Purpose: Analyze the distribution of respondents' ages to understand which age groups are most and least represented in the survey. This can help identify if the data is skewed towards a particular demographic, which is crucial for interpreting how generalizable the results might be.

Analysis Extension: Comparing the distribution of ages with the responses can reveal if certain age groups tend to view certain topics as more or less taboo, indicating generational shifts in perceptions.

2. Taboo Ratings by Category
Visualization Type: Box Plot

Purpose: If the dataset includes ratings on how taboo different topics are perceived to be, a box plot could be used to display the spread and central tendency of taboo ratings across different categories or topics.

Analysis Extension: This visualization could be extended to examine if there are significant outliers or if certain topics have a wide range of opinions, suggesting controversy or diverse viewpoints within the population.

3. Correlation of Taboo Perceptions with Demographic Variables
Visualization Type: Heatmap or Correlation Matrix

Purpose: Explore correlations between how taboo topics are rated and demographic variables such as age, gender, or other collected variables. A heatmap can effectively show the strength and direction of these relationships.

Analysis Extension: By analyzing these correlations, you could potentially uncover demographic predictors of attitudes towards taboo topics. This would be particularly useful in applications such as targeted educational programs or in understanding cultural shifts.

4. Trends Over Time (if timestamp data available)
Visualization Type: Time Series Plot

Purpose: If the dataset contains timestamps for when surveys were completed, plotting changes in the ratings of taboo topics over time could reveal trends or shifts in societal attitudes.

Analysis Extension: This could be particularly insightful if linked to major societal or cultural events, helping to understand how public sentiments shift in response to external influences.

Implementation in R
Here’s a general outline of how you might create one of these visualizations, specifically a histogram of age groups, using R:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)

# Load data
data <- read_csv("path/to/your/taboo-ratings-raw.csv")

# Assuming there is a column 'age' in your dataset
ggplot(data, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Age Groups",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
Note: Replace "path/to/your/taboo-ratings-raw.csv" with the actual path to your CSV file and adjust the column name 'age' to match your dataset.

Each of these ideas could provide a deeper understanding of the data beyond mere presentation, helping to identify patterns, associations, and trends that are relevant for further analysis or decision-making. If you need specific R scripts for the other visualization ideas or have additional data points, feel free to ask!

User
Ok! Let's create the first 3 graphs using the taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet that we created earlier
ChatGPT
To create the first three graphs using the taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet file that we previously cleaned, we'll focus on:

Distribution of Age Groups using a histogram.
Taboo Ratings by Category using box plots (assuming there are categorical ratings available).
Correlation of Taboo Perceptions with Demographic Variables using a heatmap or correlation matrix.
Here's how you can create each of these visualizations in R using the cleaned dataset. First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed and loaded:

r
Copy code
# Install necessary packages if not already installed
if (!require("ggplot2")) install.packages("ggplot2")
if (!require("arrow")) install.packages("arrow")
if (!require("dplyr")) install.packages("dplyr")
if (!require("corrplot")) install.packages("corrplot")

# Load the necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)
library(corrplot)
1. Distribution of Age Groups (Histogram)
Assuming 'selfage' is the age column, modify if your column is named differently.

r
Copy code
# Read the cleaned data
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Histogram of Age Groups
ggplot(data_cleaned, aes(x = selfage)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Age Groups",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
2. Taboo Ratings by Category (Box Plot)
We assume that there's a column called taboo_rating representing ratings and category for different taboo topics.

r
Copy code
# Box Plot of Taboo Ratings by Category
ggplot(data_cleaned, aes(x = category, y = taboo_rating)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Taboo Ratings by Category",
       x = "Category",
       y = "Rating") +
  theme_minimal()
3. Correlation of Taboo Perceptions with Demographic Variables (Heatmap)
Assuming there are several demographic variables and ratings to analyze correlations.

r
Copy code
# Subset data for correlation analysis
# Assuming 'selfage', 'gender', 'education_level', and 'taboo_rating' are relevant
correlation_data <- select(data_cleaned, selfage, gender, education_level, taboo_rating)

# Compute correlations (using a simple method for demonstration; adjust as needed for categorical data)
correlation_matrix <- cor(na.omit(correlation_data))

# Plotting the correlation matrix
corrplot(correlation_matrix, method = "circle")
Note:
You might need to adjust column names and the data cleaning process based on the actual structure and content of your cleaned dataset. The examples assume certain columns and data types.
For categorical data, especially in correlations, more sophisticated statistical techniques or data transformations might be required (e.g., converting factors to dummy variables).
These scripts will create three separate visualizations, each providing insights into different aspects of the dataset. Run each block of code in your R environment to generate the graphs. If there are any issues with missing data, incorrect assumptions about data structure, or specific customizations needed, let me know!

User
Graph 2, we do not have a dedicated variable called "category". Rather, we have several variables with their own rating. Adjust this graph to these parameters. The category names are in the original csv; they follow the format of "firsttime", "teasing", "normalsex", "analsex", etc
ChatGPT
To adjust the visualization for Taboo Ratings by Category when each category is represented as its own column in the dataset, we need to reshape the data from a wide format to a long format. This transformation will allow us to create a box plot where each variable (like "firsttime", "teasing", "normalsex", "analsex", etc.) becomes a category on the x-axis, and their values are used for the y-axis in the box plot.

We'll use the gather() function from the tidyr package (or pivot_longer() if using newer versions of tidyr) to reshape the dataset, then plot with ggplot2. Here's how to proceed:

Step 1: Install and Load Necessary Packages
Ensure all packages are installed and loaded into your R session.

r
Copy code
# Install necessary packages if not already installed
if (!require("ggplot2")) install.packages("ggplot2")
if (!require("arrow")) install.packages("arrow")
if (!require("tidyr")) install.packages("tidyr")

# Load the necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(arrow)
library(tidyr)
Step 2: Read the Data and Reshape It
Assuming the file taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet contains columns for each taboo category like "firsttime", "teasing", etc.

r
Copy code
# Read the cleaned data
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Reshape the data to a long format
data_long <- pivot_longer(data_cleaned,
                          cols = c("firsttime", "teasing", "normalsex", "analsex", ...),  # Add all other relevant columns here
                          names_to = "category",
                          values_to = "rating")

# View the first few rows of the reshaped data to ensure correctness
head(data_long)
Step 3: Create the Box Plot
Now that we have a long format dataset with category names and their corresponding ratings, we can plot them.

r
Copy code
# Box Plot of Taboo Ratings by Category
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = category, y = rating)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Taboo Ratings by Category",
       x = "Category",
       y = "Rating") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis_text_x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability
Explanation:
pivot_longer() converts data from wide format (separate columns for each category) to long format (one column for category names and one for values), which is more suitable for ggplot.
ggplot() with geom_boxplot() creates a box plot, which will now display a box for each category such as "firsttime", "teasing", etc., showing the distribution of ratings.
X-axis labels are rotated for better visibility when you have multiple categories.
This script will generate a box plot that clearly shows the distribution, median, and potential outliers for ratings across different taboo topics, offering insightful comparisons between the categories. Adjust the cols argument in pivot_longer() to include all specific columns from your dataset that correspond to different taboo topics. If you encounter any issues or need further adjustments, feel free to ask!

User
Instead of directly naming each column we want, can we simply use the range 6:50?
ChatGPT
Certainly! If the columns of interest are within a specific range, such as from the 6th to the 50th column in your dataset, you can use an index-based approach to select these columns dynamically when reshaping your data. This approach avoids manually naming each column and is especially useful if you have many columns to include.

Here's how you can adjust the code to use a range of columns for creating the box plot using the pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package:

Adjusted R Script for Using Column Ranges
r
Copy code
# Install necessary packages if not already installed
if (!require("ggplot2")) install.packages("ggplot2")
if (!require("arrow")) install.packages("arrow")
if (!require("tidyr")) install.packages("tidyr")

# Load the necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(arrow)
library(tidyr)

# Read the cleaned data
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Reshape the data to a long format using a specific range of columns (6th to 50th)
data_long <- pivot_longer(data_cleaned,
                          cols = 6:50,  # Use the column indices directly
                          names_to = "category",
                          values_to = "rating")

# View the first few rows of the reshaped data to ensure correctness
head(data_long)

# Box Plot of Taboo Ratings by Category
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = category, y = rating)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Taboo Ratings by Category",
       x = "Category",
       y = "Rating") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis_text_x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability
Key Adjustments:
cols = 6:50: This part of the pivot_longer() function now specifies that columns from the 6th to the 50th should be transformed from wide to long format. It assumes that these columns contain the data for various taboo categories you want to analyze.
Rotation of X-axis Labels: The theme() function is used to rotate the text on the x-axis, making it easier to read the category labels when they are numerous or long.
Considerations:
Ensure the Range is Correct: Double-check that the columns you specify (6 to 50 in this case) indeed correspond to the categories of taboo ratings. The column index is based on the position in the DataFrame, not necessarily the position in the original CSV, especially after any cleaning or transformations.
Data Integrity: Make sure that all columns in the specified range are appropriate for a box plot (i.e., they contain numeric data and represent similar types of variables).
This approach simplifies the script and is particularly efficient for handling datasets with a large number of similar columns. If the columns have mixed types or there are any other specific requirements, adjustments may be needed.

User
Error in `mapply()`:
! The `axis_text_x` theme element is not defined in the element hierarchy.
ChatGPT
The error message you encountered related to the axis_text_x theme element suggests a slight mistake in the syntax or the way the theme settings are applied in the ggplot2 function. This can happen due to changes in package versions or incorrect usage of theme elements.

Here's how you can correctly set the rotation for the x-axis labels in a ggplot2 plot:

Correcting X-axis Label Rotation
Use element_text() correctly within theme(): Ensure that you are modifying the x-axis text inside the correct theme element. For rotating the x-axis labels in ggplot2, it's typically done under axis.text.x.
Here's how to adjust your ggplot line to correctly rotate the x-axis labels:

r
Copy code
# Box Plot of Taboo Ratings by Category
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = category, y = rating)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Taboo Ratings by Category",
       x = "Category",
       y = "Rating") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Correctly rotate x-axis labels
Explanation:
axis.text.x: This is the correct theme element for modifying the x-axis text properties in a ggplot2 plot. Using element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1) sets the angle of the text rotation to 45 degrees and adjusts the horizontal justification so that labels are centered appropriately at their ends.
This adjustment should resolve the error and allow your x-axis labels to be displayed at a 45-degree angle, enhancing readability, especially when there are many categories or longer text labels.

If the issue persists or if you encounter other complications, it could be helpful to ensure that your version of ggplot2 is up to date, as sometimes syntax or available features can change slightly between versions. You can update ggplot2 (and other packages) using update.packages() if needed.

User
Lets split the graph into 4 separate ones that are displayed in an array. For example, each graph is a range of 11 columns, the first one being 6:16
ChatGPT
To create a series of plots where each plot shows a subset of the columns (each covering a range of 11 columns), you can use facet_wrap() in ggplot2. However, for your specific request to split the data based on column ranges and display them separately, a better approach would be to create separate plots and arrange them using gridExtra or patchwork to control the layout.

First, let's generate four separate plots, each plot using a specific range of columns from the cleaned data. We will use patchwork to arrange these plots as it provides a simple interface for organizing multiple plots. Here’s how to proceed:

Step 1: Install and Load Necessary Packages
Ensure you have the required libraries installed and loaded.

r
Copy code
# Install necessary packages if not already installed
if (!require("ggplot2")) install.packages("ggplot2")
if (!require("arrow")) install.packages("arrow")
if (!require("tidyr")) install.packages("tidyr")
if (!require("patchwork")) install.packages("patchwork")

# Load the necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(arrow)
library(tidyr)
library(patchwork)
Step 2: Read Data and Create Plots
r
Copy code
# Read the cleaned data
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Create multiple plots with different column ranges
plots <- list()
column_ranges <- list(6:16, 17:27, 28:38, 39:49)  # Define column ranges

for (i in seq_along(column_ranges)) {
    # Reshape the data to a long format using specific column ranges
    data_long <- pivot_longer(data_cleaned,
                              cols = column_ranges[[i]],
                              names_to = "category",
                              values_to = "rating")
  
    # Generate each plot
    p <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = category, y = rating)) +
         geom_boxplot() +
         labs(title = paste("Taboo Ratings by Category", i),
              x = "Category",
              y = "Rating") +
         theme_minimal() +
         theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))
    plots[[i]] <- p
}

# Combine plots into a single layout
combined_plot <- wrap_plots(plots, ncol = 2)
Explanation:
pivot_longer(): Reshapes a slice of the dataset to long format, appropriate for each plot.
ggplot(): Creates the boxplot for each subset.
wrap_plots() from patchwork: Combines the plots into a 2x2 grid layout.
Step 3: Display or Save the Combined Plot
To display:

r
Copy code
print(combined_plot)
To save:

r
Copy code
ggsave("combined_taboo_ratings.pdf", combined_plot, width = 11, height = 8.5)
Note:
Adjust the column_ranges if the column indices don't exactly match your dataset or if there are fewer/more columns than anticipated.
Make sure that each column range only includes columns that are appropriate for the boxplot (i.e., numeric columns related to ratings).
This approach allows you to visually compare different subsets of the data side by side, helping to identify any patterns or anomalies in how different categories are rated. If you need further customization or encounter any issues with the code, please let me know!

Make these graphs display a bit bigger
ChatGPT
To make the graphs display bigger, especially when arranging them in an array using patchwork, you can adjust the size when displaying them in an R environment or when saving them to a file. Here's how to enhance the visualization size effectively:

Adjusting Graph Display Size
When working within an interactive R environment like RStudio, the plot size can be adjusted in the "Plots" panel settings. However, for programmatic control, especially when arranging multiple plots using patchwork, you'll want to specify the size during the saving process using ggsave(), or adjust the plot rendering size directly in the script.

Modify the Script to Save Bigger Graphs
Here’s how to modify the script to create and save these plots at a larger size:

r
Copy code
# Install necessary packages if not already installed
if (!require("ggplot2")) install.packages("ggplot2")
if (!require("arrow")) install.packages("arrow")
if (!require("tidyr")) install.packages("tidyr")
if (!require("patchwork")) install.packages("patchwork")

# Load the necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(arrow)
library(tidyr)
library(patchwork)

# Read the cleaned data
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Create multiple plots with different column ranges
plots <- list()
column_ranges <- list(6:16, 17:27, 28:38, 39:49)  # Define column ranges

for (i in seq_along(column_ranges)) {
    # Reshape the data to a long format using specific column ranges
    data_long <- pivot_longer(data_cleaned,
                              cols = column_ranges[[i]],
                              names_to = "category",
                              values_to = "rating")
  
    # Generate each plot
    p <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = category, y = rating)) +
         geom_boxplot() +
         labs(title = paste("Taboo Ratings by Category", i),
              x = "Category",
              y = "Rating") +
         theme_minimal() +
         theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))
    plots[[i]] <- p
}

# Combine plots into a single layout
combined_plot <- wrap_plots(plots, ncol = 2)

# Display the plot
print(combined_plot)

# Save the plot at a larger size
ggsave("combined_taboo_ratings.png", combined_plot, width = 16, height = 12, dpi = 300)
Key Adjustments for Bigger Graph Display:
ggsave() Parameters:
width and height: Set these parameters to control the size of the output file. Here, the width is set to 16 inches and the height to 12 inches, which is quite large and suitable for detailed inspection of the plots.
dpi: Dots per inch, set to 300 for high resolution, which ensures that the details in the plots are crisp and clear, especially useful when dealing with multiple plots in one figure.
This setup ensures that the graphs are not only bigger in terms of the physical size but also maintain high quality, which is crucial for presentations or publications where detail is paramount. Adjust the width and height values according to your specific needs or constraints (e.g., intended display medium or aspect ratio). If you have any further questions or need additional adjustments, feel free to ask!

User
You misunderstand me. I don't wish to save these graphs larger; I wish for them to display larger in the array from the beginning as they are unreadable right now
ChatGPT
To increase the display size of the graphs within an R environment such as RStudio, especially when they are arranged in an array, you can adjust the output size directly in your plotting script. This adjustment primarily affects how plots appear in your interactive environment.

Using Plotting Options to Increase Display Size
Here's how to modify your script to increase the plot size during display:

Adjust Plot Dimensions in RStudio: You can specify the plot dimensions directly in the plotting pane settings or programmatically adjust the plot rendering dimensions in R.
Use patchwork Plot Area Allocation: Adjust the plot layout to ensure each subplot has enough space when displayed in a grid format.
Here’s the revised script:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(arrow)
library(tidyr)
library(patchwork)

# Read the cleaned data
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Create multiple plots with different column ranges
plots <- list()
column_ranges <- list(6:16, 17:27, 28:38, 39:49)  # Define column ranges

for (i in seq_along(column_ranges)) {
    # Reshape the data to a long format using specific column ranges
    data_long <- pivot_longer(data_cleaned,
                              cols = column_ranges[[i]],
                              names_to = "category",
                              values_to = "rating")
  
    # Generate each plot
    p <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = category, y = rating)) +
         geom_boxplot() +
         labs(title = paste("Taboo Ratings by Category", i),
              x = "Category",
              y = "Rating") +
         theme_minimal() +
         theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1),
               plot.title = element_text(size = 14))  # Enhance title size for better readability
    plots[[i]] <- p
}

# Combine plots into a single layout
combined_plot <- wrap_plots(plots, ncol = 2)

# Modify options to set default plot size in RStudio
options(repr.plot.width = 16, repr.plot.height = 12)  # Adjust size as needed

# Display the plot
print(combined_plot)
Key Adjustments:
options(repr.plot.width = 16, repr.plot.height = 12): This command sets the default plot size in RStudio to 16 inches wide by 12 inches high. Adjust these values based on your screen resolution and size preferences. These options are particularly useful in Jupyter notebooks and might behave differently depending on your RStudio version or settings.
theme() adjustments: Increased the font size for plot titles to enhance readability.
This setup ensures that the plots are displayed larger from the beginning in your R environment, making them easier to read and analyze. If you’re not using RStudio or if the options() command does not effectively change the plot size in your environment, you may need to adjust the settings directly through the RStudio IDE under Tools -> Global Options -> Pane Layout or similar options.

If you still face issues with the display size or need further assistance with customization, please let me know!

Is it possible to make the graphs inherently taller? The Y axis is extremely compressed
ChatGPT
Certainly, making the individual graphs taller to expand the Y-axis and reduce compression involves adjusting the aspect ratio and overall size of each plot. Using patchwork, you can control the layout and dimensions of each plot individually or collectively. Here’s how to adjust the size and aspect ratio to make the Y-axis less compressed:

Adjusting Plot Size and Aspect Ratio
You can control the size of each plot in the array by setting specific dimensions when combining plots with patchwork. This allows you to allocate more space vertically, making each plot taller and less compressed on the Y-axis.

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(arrow)
library(tidyr)
library(patchwork)

# Read the cleaned data
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Create multiple plots with different column ranges
plots <- list()
column_ranges <- list(6:16, 17:27, 28:38, 39:49)  # Define column ranges

for (i in seq_along(column_ranges)) {
    # Reshape the data to a long format using specific column ranges
    data_long <- pivot_longer(data_cleaned,
                              cols = column_ranges[[i]],
                              names_to = "category",
                              values_to = "rating")
  
    # Generate each plot
    p <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = category, y = rating)) +
         geom_boxplot() +
         labs(title = paste("Taboo Ratings by Category", i),
              x = "Category",
              y = "Rating") +
         theme_minimal() +
         theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1),
               plot.title = element_text(size = 14))  # Enhance title size for better readability
    plots[[i]] <- p
}

# Combine plots into a single layout with specific height allocation
combined_plot <- wrap_plots(plots, ncol = 2) +
                 plot_layout(heights = c(2, 2, 2, 2))  # Specify the relative heights

# Display the plot
print(combined_plot)
Explanation:
plot_layout(heights = c(2, 2, 2, 2)): This line within the patchwork syntax specifies the relative heights of the rows in the plot grid. By setting these values, you can allocate more vertical space to each plot. Adjust these values as needed to achieve the desired aspect ratio and overall plot height.
Note:
Aspect Ratio Control: While patchwork manages the layout, each individual plot's aspect ratio can be influenced by the coord_fixed() function from ggplot2 to force a certain height-to-width ratio.
Custom Sizing in ggplot2: You can directly manipulate the plot dimensions in ggplot2 with theme() to adjust text sizes, margins, and other elements that may contribute to feeling compressed.
This approach should help address the issue of the compressed Y-axis by making each plot inherently taller and better proportioned. Adjust the heights parameter as needed based on your specific visualization needs and the data characteristics. If further adjustments are needed, please let me know!

User
The heights parameter does nothing
ChatGPT
You're correct; I apologize for the oversight. The heights parameter in plot_layout() from patchwork is used for arranging different rows of plots and doesn't directly control the size of individual plots. To adjust the height of each plot in the array, you can specify the height directly within each plot's ggplot object.

Here's how you can modify the script to make each plot taller and reduce compression on the Y-axis:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

               plot.title = element_text(size = 14),
               plot.margin = margin(20, 20, 40, 20)) +  # Adjust the bottom margin to make room for taller plots
         coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, max(data_long$rating) + 1))  # Adjust the y-axis limits to leave space at the top
    plots[[i]] <- p
}

# Combine plots into a single layout
combined_plot <- wrap_plots(plots, ncol = 2)

# Display the plot
print(combined_plot)
Explanation:
plot.margin: By adjusting the bottom margin of each plot, we make room for taller plots by increasing the space between the bottom of the plot and the x-axis labels.
coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, max(data_long$rating) + 1)): We adjust the y-axis limits to leave some space at the top of each plot, preventing the topmost points from being cut off and further reducing compression on the Y-axis.
You can further adjust the margins and plot dimensions as needed to achieve the desired appearance and readability. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

To ensure your plots display taller and address issues with the compressed Y-axis, let's focus on adjusting each plot's individual dimensions directly in RStudio, as it seems the previous adjustments weren't effective for your setup.

Adjusting Individual Plot Dimensions in R
We will use the ggsave() function to explicitly set the dimensions of each plot when saving, which also reflects in RStudio when you use the plotting window. Although ggsave() is typically used for saving, specifying dimensions can help you visualize the setup before you decide to save.

Here’s a new approach, where we’ll control plot size directly through the display settings in RStudio and by making each plot larger through dimensions specified in `ggs

I understand that adjusting the appearance of the graphs has been challenging. Let's directly focus on improving the legibility of your graphs displayed in the R environment. We will ensure that each plot has adequate height and width, and we'll adjust the text size and spacing to enhance readability.

To make these plots more legible, we'll approach this by:

Adjusting text sizes and the spacing between elements.
Explicitly setting the size of the display area for plots within the RStudio Viewer or Plots Pane.
Step-by-Step Guide to Adjusting Plot Appearance:
Adjust Plot Appearance: Increase the text size, adjust the plot margins, and manage the layout to ensure elements are not crowded.
Control Plot Output in RStudio: Adjust the size at which plots appear in RStudio to make them larger and easier to read.

Here is what the graphs look like. Please, I beg you, make them legible because none of your suggestions are working.

I appreciate the visual context; it helps a lot to see what we’re working with. To make the plots more legible, we’ll need to improve the aspect ratio of each plot and enhance the text size for clarity. Since the X-axis labels appear to be cluttered and overlapping, adjusting the angle and margin can also improve legibility.

Here's a script that should help enhance the appearance of your plots:

r
Copy code
# Assuming you have already loaded the ggplot2, tidyr, patchwork, and arrow libraries and the data

# Create a function to generate a single plot for a given range of columns
generate_plot <- function(data, col_range, index) {
  data_long <- pivot_longer(data,
                            cols = col_range,
                            names_to = "category",
                            values_to = "rating")
  
  plot <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = category, y = rating)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1),
          axis.title.x = element_blank(),
          axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
          plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold")) +
    labs(title = paste("Graph", index))
  
  return(plot)
}

# Define the column ranges for each plot
col_ranges <- list(6:16, 17:27, 28:38, 39:49)

# Apply the function to generate all plots
plots <- lapply(seq_along(col_ranges), function(i) {
  generate_plot(data_cleaned, col_ranges[[i]], i)
})

# Combine the plots using patchwork
plot_layout <- reduce(plots, `+`) + 
  plot_layout(guides = "collect") & 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# View the combined plot in a larger plotting window
print(plot_layout)
Adjustments Made:
Increased Text Sizes: The text sizes for axis titles and plot titles have been increased to improve readability.
X-axis Labels Rotated: The labels are now rotated to 90 degrees, which is often better for narrow plots as it prevents overlapping labels.
Blank X-axis Titles: Removed x-axis titles for clarity, as they can clutter the plot if they are not providing additional information.
Theme Adjustments: Used theme_minimal() to keep the focus on the data, and adjusted margins and text sizes within the theme settings.
Displaying Plots in RStudio:
When working with RStudio, you can control the size of the plot output in the "Plots" panel. Dragging the edges of the panel to manually adjust the size can help, but sometimes the changes are not enough for complex plots. The above script should provide a good balance by improving the appearance directly through theme settings.

If you wish to adjust the display size programmatically, RStudio’s options for the plot panel (repr.plot.width and repr.plot.height) are generally used in Jupyter notebooks and may not always affect the RStudio plot display. Instead, RStudio retains the size of the plot panel from the last manual adjustment you perform in the IDE interface.

Please copy and paste this script into your R environment, and let me know how the plots turn out. If there are still issues with legibility, we may need to consider saving the plots individually and adjusting the size or splitting the graphs into even smaller groups for display.

          axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),  # Remove y-axis ticks
          axis.title.y = element_blank(),  # Remove y-axis title
          plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold")) +
    labs(title = paste("Graph", index))
  
  return(plot)
}

# Define the column ranges for each plot
col_ranges <- list(6:16, 17:27, 28:38, 39:49)

# Apply the function to generate all plots
plots <- lapply(seq_along(col_ranges), function(i) {
  generate_plot(data_cleaned, col_ranges[[i]], i)
})

# Combine the plots using patchwork
plot_layout <- reduce(plots, `+`) + 
  plot_layout(guides = "collect") & 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# View the combined plot in a larger plotting window
print(plot_layout)
Adjustments Made:
axis.text.y = element_blank(): Hides the text labels on the y-axis.
axis.ticks.y = element_blank(): Hides the tick marks on the y-axis.
axis.title.y = element_blank(): Removes the y-axis title.
This will remove all y-axis labeling and titling, giving a cleaner look focused on the x-axis categories and the distribution of ratings. If the x-axis labels now appear too dense, you may consider displaying fewer categories per plot or further splitting the data into more plots.

Run this adjusted script in your R environment, and the plots should now display without any y-axis labels or titles. If you need additional adjustments, just let me know.

Remove the title as well to maximize space
ChatGPT
To maximize space and focus entirely on the graph content, you can remove the plot titles by omitting the labs(title = paste("Graph", index)) line. You can also make adjustments to the theme to remove any plot titles or subtitles. Here's the updated function:

r
Copy code
# Create a function to generate a single plot for a given range of columns
generate_plot <- function(data, col_range) {
  data_long <- pivot_longer(data,
                            cols = col_range,
                            names_to = "category",
                            values_to = "rating")
  
  plot <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = category, y = rating)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1),
          axis.text.y = element_blank(),   # Remove y-axis text/labels
          axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),  # Remove y-axis ticks
          axis.title.y = element_blank(),  # Remove y-axis title
          axis.title.x = element_blank(),  # Remove x-axis title
          plot.title = element_blank())    # Remove plot title
  
  return(plot)
}

# Define the column ranges for each plot
col_ranges <- list(6:16, 17:27, 28:38, 39:49)

# Apply the function to generate all plots
plots <- lapply(col_ranges, function(col_range) {
  generate_plot(data_cleaned, col_range)
})

# Combine the plots using patchwork
plot_layout <- wrap_plots(plots, ncol = 2)

# View the combined plot in a larger plotting window
print(plot_layout)
Changes Made:
Removed the labs() call, which was setting the title.
Removed plot.title by setting element_blank() within the theme() call to remove any default titles that may be applied.
Optionally, also removed the axis.title.x in case you want to remove x-axis titles for further space optimization.
Now the plots will display without any titles, maximizing the space available for the actual data visualization. You can execute this code in your R environment, and the resulting plots will fill more of the plotting area, hopefully making them more legible.

Remember, if the plots are still not displaying well within RStudio, consider manually resizing the "Plots" pane by dragging its edges to change the dimensions. This action can significantly affect the rendered size of the plots within the RStudio environment.

How can I apply a model to a graph?
ChatGPT
Applying a model to a graph generally means fitting a statistical model to your data and then overlaying the model's predictions or trends on your plot. In R, this is often done with ggplot2 by adding a layer to your graph that represents the model.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this using a linear model as an example:

Fit a Model: Use a statistical model to fit your data. For instance, you could fit a linear regression model using the lm() function.
Add Model to Graph: Use ggplot2 to create your graph and add the model as a layer with geom_smooth() for a regression line, or use stat_smooth() if you want to display the confidence interval around the regression line.
Plot the Model: Display or save the plot with the model applied.
Here's how you could implement this with an example dataset:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming 'data_cleaned' is your dataset and it has two continuous variables 'x' and 'y'
# Fit a linear model
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = data_cleaned)

# Plot the data with the model applied
ggplot(data_cleaned, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +                          # Plot the actual data points
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",              # Add a smooth regression line
              se = FALSE) +               # 'se = FALSE' removes the confidence interval shading
  theme_minimal()                         # Use a minimal theme for a clean look
If you want to visualize the predictions of the model for a set of new data, you can create a new dataframe with the predictor values, use the predict() function with your model, and then plot the predicted values:

r
Copy code
# Create a new dataframe for prediction
new_data <- data.frame(x = seq(min(data_cleaned$x), max(data_cleaned$x), length.out = 100))

# Predict 'y' using the model
new_data$y_predicted <- predict(model, newdata = new_data)

# Add the predictions to the plot
ggplot(data_cleaned, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +  # Plot the actual data points
  geom_line(data = new_data, aes(x = x, y = y_predicted), color = "blue") +  # Plot the predicted values
  theme_minimal()  # Use a minimal theme for a clean look
In these examples, x and y should be replaced with the actual column names from your dataset that you're using for the model. The plot will show the actual data points and the trend line (or predicted values) from your model.

For other types of models or more complex relationships, you might use different geom_ functions that correspond to the type of model or prediction you want to visualize. If you can provide more details about the type of model and what you're aiming to visualize, I can give you a more specific example.

add a line of best fit to this graph

# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file (if needed)
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-average-agescore.parquet")

# Assuming 'data_cleaned' contains columns 'selfage' and 'average' where 'average' is the mean scores for 'selfage'
# Generate a line graph
ggplot(data_cleaned, aes(x = selfage, y = average)) +
  geom_line() +  # This adds the line layer
  geom_point() +  # Optionally add points to the line graph
  labs(title = "Line Graph of Average Data",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Average Score") +
  theme_minimal()  # Optional: Adds a minimal theme
ChatGPT
To add a line of best fit to your graph, you can use geom_smooth() with the method set to lm, which stands for linear model. This will add a regression line that fits the selfage and average data points in your dataset. Here's how to modify your existing ggplot code:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(arrow)

# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-average-agescore.parquet")

# Generate a line graph with a line of best fit
ggplot(data_cleaned, aes(x = selfage, y = average)) +
  geom_line() +                             # Add the line layer
  geom_point() +                            # Optionally add points to the line graph
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) +  # Add a red line of best fit without a confidence interval
  labs(title = "Line Graph of Average Data",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Average Score") +
  theme_minimal()                           # Add a minimal theme
In the code snippet above, geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) adds the line of best fit over your data. The se = FALSE argument removes the shaded confidence interval around the line to keep the graph clean, but you can remove this if you'd like to see the confidence interval.

This code assumes that selfage and average are the correct column names for age and average scores, respectively, and that these columns are numeric. When you run this code in R, it will produce a plot with your data points connected by a line, along with a red line of best fit that represents the linear relationship between age and average score.

User
Remove title
ChatGPT
To remove the title from the graph, simply omit the labs(title = "Line Graph of Average Data") line from your ggplot call. Here's the revised code without the plot title:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(arrow)

# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-average-agescore.parquet")

# Generate a line graph with a line of best fit and no title
ggplot(data_cleaned, aes(x = selfage, y = average)) +
  geom_line() +                             # Add the line layer
  geom_point() +                            # Optionally add points to the line graph
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) +  # Add a red line of best fit without a confidence interval
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Average Score") +    # Add labels for x and y axes
  theme_minimal()                           # Add a minimal theme
By removing the labs(title = ...) line, the graph will no longer display a title, giving a cleaner look and more space to the actual data visualization. The x and y axis labels will still be displayed as specified in the labs() function. If you wish to remove or adjust any other elements, such as axis labels or tick marks, you can further modify the theme() call to suit your needs.

Create a graph which compares 2 age groups by a variable called "average".

The two age groups are 14 to 43 and 44 to 100. These come from the variable "selfage" and the parquet file we are using to make this graph is data/analysis_data/taboo-average-agescore.parquet
ChatGPT
To compare two age groups by the "average" variable, we need to first categorize the "selfage" variable into the two specified groups. Then, we can create a boxplot or a similar graph to compare the "average" values across these two groups.

Here is an R script that does this:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)

# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-average-agescore.parquet")

# Categorize 'selfage' into two groups
data_grouped <- data_cleaned %>%
  mutate(age_group = case_when(
    selfage >= 14 & selfage <= 43 ~ "14-43",
    selfage >= 44 & selfage <= 100 ~ "44-100",
    TRUE ~ as.character(selfage)  # To handle any ages outside the specified ranges, if any
  )) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(average = mean(average, na.rm = TRUE))

# Create a graph comparing the two age groups
ggplot(data_grouped, aes(x = age_group, y = average, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(x = "Age Group", y = "Average") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  # Hide the legend if not needed
In this script:

The mutate() function along with case_when() is used to create a new factor variable age_group based on selfage.
The group_by() and summarise() functions calculate the mean average for each age group.
The ggplot() function creates a bar graph where each bar represents one of the age groups.
The geom_bar(stat = "identity") indicates that the height of the bar should represent the value in the average column directly.

Note that this script assumes the "average" variable is already a summary statistic for the "selfage" groups. If the "average" needs to be calculated, you would first group by the new age_group and then summarize to find the mean.

Remember to replace the "data/analysis_data/taboo-average-agescore.parquet" path with the actual path where your Parquet file is stored if it's different. Also, this script creates a bar graph for simplicity, but you can adjust the geom_ function to create a different type of plot if preferred.

Explain how we cleaned our data in bullet point form. Focus less on the R script used, rather what columns/rows were eliminated and why
ChatGPT
Certainly, here are the bullet points summarizing the cleaning process applied to the dataset:

Removed Metadata Columns:
Columns such as "User", "Run", "Program Version", "Time Started (UTC)", "Time Finished (UTC)", "Minutes Spent", "Position", "Points", and "arousalScale" were removed. These columns likely contained metadata about the survey execution and environment which are not relevant to the analysis of survey responses.
Dropped Age Identifier Column:
The "Your age?" column, which may have been used to filter or categorize responses, was eliminated, likely because we categorized age differently or to maintain respondent anonymity.
Excluded Columns with Bracketed Codes:
Any column with a name that contained bracketed codes was dropped. These might have been specific to the survey software or used for internal tracking, and not necessary for the analysis.
Filtered Out Incomplete Age Data:
Rows where the "selfage" variable was NA (missing data) were removed to ensure the analysis was based only on records with complete age information.
Binned Age Groups:
The "selfage" column was used to create two age groups, one ranging from 14 to 43 and another from 44 to 100, for focused analysis on these demographics.
The cleaning was targeted at simplifying the dataset to contain only the essential variables needed for the intended analysis, improving the clarity and quality of the data, and ensuring that any analysis performed would be on complete cases with relevant and accurate information.

ChatGPT
Our model is like a recipe that predicts the "average" score based on a person's age. Here's the simple breakdown:

Starting Point (Intercept): Imagine everyone starts with a score of about 2.23, which is the starting point when age is zero.
Age Influence (Slope): For each additional year in age, the score decreases slightly, by about 0.012. It's a small but consistent dip.
Consistency (Residuals): The model isn't perfect—some people's scores are higher or lower than it predicts. But most differences (residuals) are quite small, showing our recipe is generally on the right track.
Confidence in the Recipe (Coefficients): We're pretty sure about the starting point and how much age affects the score—the p-values here are very, very small, telling us these aren't random guesses.
Goodness of the Recipe (R-squared): Our recipe explains over half (about 52%) of why people's scores vary. That's not everything, but it's a good chunk, meaning age is a strong ingredient in predicting the average score.
In summary, our simple model gives us a reliable way to predict how someone might score based on their age, with younger people tending to have slightly higher scores than older people, at least in this particular dataset.

User
explain the x/y of it briefly
ChatGPT
In our model, the x-axis (the horizontal line) represents age, which we've called "selfage." The y-axis (the vertical line) represents the "average" score from our dataset.

When you look at the graph of our model:

Any point along the x-axis shows an age.
Moving up or down from that point on the x-axis takes you to a point on the y-axis, which shows the predicted average score for that age.
So, the x/y relationship here is about seeing how the average score (y) changes as age (x) increases or decreases. According to our model, as we move to the right on the x-axis (which means we're looking at older ages), the average score tends to go down.

give me the latex to add the formula to a .qmd file
ChatGPT
To add the formula for the linear model to a .qmd (Quarto markdown) file using LaTeX, you'll want to write the formula in a way that clearly represents the relationship you've modeled between age (selfage) and the average score. Here's how you can format this:

latex
Copy code
$$
\text{average} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{selfage}
$$
Here, \beta_0 and \beta_1 represent the intercept and the slope of the model, respectively. You can replace them with the actual numerical values from your model output:

latex
Copy code
$$
\text{average} = 2.2286 - 0.0121 \times \text{selfage}
$$
This equation states that the average score can be predicted by starting at 2.2286 (the intercept) and subtracting 0.0121 times a person's age (selfage).

To insert this into your .qmd file, you can simply include this block of LaTeX code where you want the equation to appear. It will render as a mathematical equation centered in your document.

Here is how you might write it in context in your .qmd file:

vbnet
Copy code
Below is the formula derived from our linear model, which describes how the average score decreases with age:

$$
\text{average} = 2.2286 - 0.0121 \times \text{selfage}
$$

This model suggests that as age increases, the average score tends to decrease by about 0.0121 for each additional year.
This should help you clearly communicate the results of your statistical analysis in your Quarto document.

Justify the model by highlighting the P-score and how the model is accurate
ChatGPT
To justify the accuracy and significance of our linear regression model in predicting how the average score depends on age, we can refer to several key statistics from the model's output, particularly the p-values associated with the coefficients and the model's overall goodness-of-fit measures. Here’s a breakdown of these aspects:

1. P-values of Coefficients:
Intercept (β₀): The p-value for the intercept is less than 2e-16, which is extremely small. This indicates that the intercept is significantly different from zero, affirming that the baseline level of the average score (the score when age is zero) is statistically significant.
Slope (β₁ for selfage): The p-value for the slope is 1.12e-11, also extremely small. This signifies that the effect of age on the average score is statistically significant. The negative coefficient (-0.0121) means that as age increases, the average score decreases, and this relationship is statistically reliable.
2. Goodness-of-Fit (R-squared):
R-squared: The value is approximately 0.516, which means that about 51.6% of the variability in the average score can be explained by age alone. This is a substantial amount, especially for a simple linear regression with only one predictor.
Adjusted R-squared: Sitting at around 0.5084, this measure adjusts the R-squared value to account for the number of predictors in the model (which is just one in this case). It confirms that our model's explanatory power is robust even after adjustments.
Justification of the Model:
Statistical Significance: The very low p-values for both the intercept and the slope confirm that these coefficients are not zero and that there is a significant linear relationship between age and average score.
Explanation of Variance: The R-squared value indicates a good level of explanation, meaning that our model does a good job of capturing the relationship between age and average score. It tells us that age is a meaningful predictor of average score, and the model captures a significant portion of the data's variability.
Practical Significance: The negative slope is practically significant too. It implies that there's a clear trend of decreasing scores with increasing age, a trend strong enough to be confidently used for predictions or decisions based on age.
LaTeX in Quarto Document:
You can include a discussion of these points directly in your .qmd file using a combination of text and LaTeX for mathematical expressions:

markdown
Copy code
The linear model we developed shows a statistically significant relationship between age (`selfage`) and average score (`average`), justified by the model's coefficients and goodness-of-fit:

- **Intercept and Slope:** The model formula is given by:
  $$
  \text{average} = 2.2286 - 0.0121 \times \text{selfage}
  $$
  where both coefficients are significantly different from zero (p < 2e-16 for intercept and p = 1.12e-11 for slope).

- **Goodness of Fit:** About 51.6% of the variability in the average score is explained by age, with an adjusted R-squared of 0.5084, underscoring the model's reliability in prediction and its utility in understanding how age influences scores.

These statistics suggest that our model is not only statistically robust but also practically useful for predicting the average score based on age.
This narrative combines statistical jargon with practical implications, making it useful for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Introduction

Data

Raw Data

{r}
#| echo: false
#| error: false
#| warning: false

# Load the raw data from the CSV file
data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/taboo-ratings-raw.csv")

# Select the first 6 rows and the first 6 columns
data_subset <- data[1:6, 1:6]

# Generate a nice-looking table
kable(data_subset, format = "html", caption = "First 6x6 Subset of Raw Data")

Raw data was collected by internet influencer Aella, using a Google Forms survey primarily distributed through the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Raw data is hosted on Aella's personal website "Knowingless", from which this data was downloaded. Data does not appear to have seen any controls for the respondents, leading to over 48,000 rows of data (most of which becomes irrelevant to us due to an "NA" answer being present in the age column). Table 1 (CITE) shows a snippet of how much noise is present in the data, which will need to be cleaned prior to any analysis conducted.

Cleaned Data

Cleaned data resulted in close to 45,000 rows of responses being eliminated from the sheet. Due to the sheer amount of data that was eliminated between the raw data and the analysis data a short breakdown of how this cleaning was conducted will be provided.

Analysis Data

{r}
#| echo: false
#| error: false
#| warning: false

# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")

# Select the first 6 rows and the first 6 columns
data_subset <- data_cleaned[1:6, 1:6]

# Generate a nice-looking table
kable(data_subset, format = "html", caption = "First 6x6 Subset of Cleaned Data")

Cleaning for the primary analysis data was mostly done through filtering metadata from the sheet (time of response, program version, empty points columns, etc). However, the majority of the cleaning ended up when empty "selfage" identifiers were filtered out. As we intend to track the effect of age on taboo rating, empty age identifiers left us with junk data which we could not use. The end sheet was approximately 3800~ rows from the 48,000~ rows which were present in the raw data. Additionally, the data was converted from .csv to .parquet - this had no impact on the responses in the data when they were compared directly. Table 2 (CITE) displays the first 6x6 entries in our cleaned data.

Average Data

{r}
#| fig-cap: "Average taboo rating of sexual acts by age."
#| label: fig-1
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| error: false


# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file (if needed)
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-average-agescore.parquet")

# Assuming 'data_cleaned' contains columns 'selfage' and 'average' where 'average' is the mean scores for 'selfage'
# Generate a line graph
ggplot(data_cleaned, aes(x = selfage, y = average)) +
  geom_line() +  # This adds the line layer
  geom_point() +  # Optionally add points to the line graph
  labs(x = "Age",
       y = "Average Score") +
  theme_minimal()  # Adds a minimal theme

A secondary cleaned dataset was created by aggregating responses by the selfage variable and finding the mean taboo rating for each aggregated age. This data set was used to create a model, which we discuss in Section 2.4 (CITE). However, based on the simple plot we create in @fig-1, preliminary analysis suggests that the data collected for younger ages (<50) is more consistent than the later ages (>50). This is likely due to weaknesses in data collection and control methodology.

Data Weaknesses

Collection

As mentioned prior, data was collected by internet influencer Aella of X (formerly known as Twitter) fame. Data was collected through a Google Form disseminated through X and the majority of respondents accessed the relevant Google Form through this platform. While there is nothing inherently wrong with collecting data through Google Forms, there lies a problem in bias when said Google Form is distributed through one platform primarily.

Aella is a prominent commentator on sex and sexuality, regularly "pushing the envelope" on controversial sex topics such as age of consent or non-traditional sexual relationships (polygamy, for example). While Aella's reach is wide due to the size of her X following (204,000~ follows as of the time of writing (CITE)), the primary audience she is reaching would be those who already follow her and hold her opinions in a higher regard. Furthermore, the average age of X users is 25-34 years old, with other age groups skewing younger. We can assume that Aella's followers are of a similar, if not younger, distribution. Age distribution is further discussed in Section 3.1.

This is all to say that Aella's data is likely to bias towards younger individuals with edgier sexual opinions than someone who has zero knowledge of Aella. This creates a limited set of respondents which cannot be used to gauge any "general" consensus on certain sex topics. While this data is phenomenal for gauging the opinions of Aella's followers, or even X users, applying this data to any broad population outside the internet is a significant stretch of credibility. Due to the way the data was collected, the applications of this data to the world outside of X is extremely limited if not outright inapplicable. The internet is not real life, therefore this data should not be treated as the opinions of the average Joe you see at Walmart.

Control

Aella's data collection lacked any form of meaningful control, leading to the vast majority of the data her Google Form collected being junk. As mentioned before, the raw excel sheet provided by Aella has around 48,000 rows of responses. Most of these responses lack a selfage answer; which is the only identifier Aella uses to distinguish responses in her data. The lack of identifiers, combined with an inherent lack of control to ensure responses are authentic, inject a "poison pill" into the data where every point needs to be taken with a grain of salt.

To elaborate further, refer to @fig-1. The average data in the pre-50 self age plots neatly and regularly - so much so that a gradual decrease can be found correlated as the age pushes towards the 50 mark. However, passed the 50 mark, the data become irregular. While this can partially be attributed to lower distribution of older ages in the data (discussed in Section 2.4), this can also be due to "fake" ages being inputted in the selfage category. As selfage is the only reliable identifier within the data, any question to the authenticity to this identifier puts the credibility of all the data in jeopardy.

To Aella's credit, this data was never intended for serious academic study. While the lack of control puts the credibility of responses into question, for Aella's intended purpose for the data (interesting discussions on taboo sexual topics) this lack of control won't take away from it. However, this data has the potential to be incredibly insightful - even a small amount of authentication for the selfage variable would've went a long way to making the responses concrete and reliable. That isn't the case, unfortunately, and the extreme irregularities for the >50 selfage respondents puts the authenticity of all responses into question, even if we were to "clean" the irregular respondents from the data.

Model

Explanation

A model was created to explore the correlation of age with the "taboo rating" Aella uses to gauge opinion on sexual acts. It is a simple linear model, where Y is the average score and X is the age. Below is the basic formula derived from our model:

$$
\text{average} = 2.2286 - 0.0121 \times \text{selfage}
$$

This model suggests that as age increases, the average score tends to decrease by about 0.0121 for each additional year.

Justification

The linear model developed to track selfage with average score indicates a statistically significant relationship between the two variables. The model above finds that  P < 2e-16 for the intercept and P = 1.12e-11 for the slope. These incredibly small P-scores signify that both the intercept and slope are significantly different from zero, and due to a negative coefficient (-0.0121) in the slope the model finds that the relationship is statistically reliable (as there is a clear negative correlation between the Y and X axis).

Furthermore, about 51.6% of the variability (0.516 in the R-squared coefficient) is explained by age. For a simple linear regression with one variable, this is an incredibly significant amount. It also aligns neatly with what we discuss in Section 2.2.2, where the younger respondents seem to plot neater than the older respondents.

These scores indicate that our model is statistically robust and therefore practically useful for predicting the average score based on age alone.

@fig-2 plots the distribution of responses based on age within the cleaned data file. What we find is that Aella's data seems to be collected from younger respondents (in relation to the overall data), centered around the average X user age range of 25-34 (CITE).

This has several key implications for the data. The primary one is, as we predicted in Section 2.2.1, there is a substantial bias in the data towards the average user of the X platform. This leads to the data being highly-specific towards X users and not applicable for much else (other than making interesting graphs and starting discussions, as was Aella's intent). Furthermore, we see a wide range of ages (specifically, age 14 to age 100) despite the vast majority of responses being in the 20-40 age range. This wide range could result in a slight skew in certain analysis, specifically pertaining to model accuracy due the model being built off a simple selfage/average rating correlation without accounting for amount of responses per selfage variable.

Essentially, analyzing the age distribution gives us the clearest indicator of data bias. As it correlates with average X user data (CITE), the biases we discuss in Section 2.2.1 become validated to a degree. Furthermore, it explains why our model has a 51.6% R-score; the midpoint of this data is coincidentally the point where respondent concentration levels off dramatically, leading to less accurate averages due to a significantly smaller sample size.

@fig-3 displays a heatmap (boxplot) of the concentration of responses to the individual sex acts present in the data. The Y-axis, low to high, displays the concentration of the scores from zero to five. @fig-3 demonstrates the strengths of the data - due to the large amount of responses we can visualize quite neatly what we culturally consider "taboo" and what is considered a "normal" sex act. While the variables are self explanatory, some are esoteric to users of social media or sex enthusiasts like Aella; if an esoteric variable comes is discussed, it will be briefly explained for context. Interestingly, we find that the majority of sex acts gauged have a middling opinion of "taboo-ness", where the scores seem to aggregate in the two-to-four score range and very few having a definitive zero (objectively normal) or five (objectively taboo). For the objective categories, there are little surprises - variables "normalsex" (where what 'normal sex' is isn't defined), "sensuality", and "romance" are entirely uncontroversial and variables that are actual crimes, such as "executions" and "pedophilia" are definitively taboo.

Beyond the extreme highs/lows, we see very stable plotting around certain ranges for each sexual topic. This indicates a form of consensus; we don't have any instances where there is a range of zero to five as a whole, rather the scores all seem to aggregate around two to three taboo scores. For example, in the bottom left cluster, we see three distinct sexual acts/categories - "creepy", "dirty",  and "futa (sexual media involving depictions of characters who possess all male and female sexual organs)" - all three of these categories have the exact same heatmap aggregating in the middle-high range of taboo score. From a data perspective, this is fascinating, as these are very distinct categories from each other. This plays to the strengths of the data; it finds meaningful insights on opinions of which sex acts are considered taboo due to the sheer amount of data points (3800~ cleaned) it utilizes.

 

Average Rating by Age

  geom_line() +                             # Add the line layer

  labs(x = "Age", y = "Average Score") +    # Add labels for x and y axes
  theme_minimal()                              

@fig-4 builds off of @fig-1 by superimposing a line of best fit to the data directly. As this graph is built using the same two variables as our model, the line of best fit is near identical to our model due to it being created through linear regression.

Observing this graph we see significant correlation with what we discussed in Section 2.3.2 - our line of best fit is near perfect in predicting the gradual decrease for ages up to the 50 mark, but then loses accuracy afterwards. While there isn't much unique to discuss, the close association of the line of best fit to our model is further indication that there is a severe bias towards the younger ages while simultaneously having unreliable data found in the higher ages (or, ages with lower proportions of distribution).

Furthermore, the way the data plots in @fig-4 indicates that certain age clusters might be using false/inauthentic selfage values. Observe the "highs" of the ages between 50 and 75 - we can draw a nearly perfect line to equal highs in earlier age groups. Due to the extremely low distribution of higher ages seen in @fig-2, alongside the inherent unlikeliness of there being respondents over the age of 60, we can hypothesize that these data points come from younger respondents who decided to falsify their age when asked to disclose it. This further corroborates our discussion in Section 2.3.2, where the lack of controls for the data make it difficult to glean meaningful, definitive conclusions from the data.  

Average Rating by Age Group

#| fig-cap: "Comparison of average rating between age groups; ages grouped by 'younger (14-43)' and 'older(44-100)' based on selfage variable from the data."

#| error: false


# Read the cleaned data from the Parquet file
data_cleaned <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/taboo-average-agescore.parquet")

# Categorize 'selfage' into two groups
data_grouped <- data_cleaned %>%
  mutate(age_group = case_when(
    selfage >= 14 & selfage <= 43 ~ "14-43",
    selfage >= 44 & selfage <= 100 ~ "44-100",
    TRUE ~ as.character(selfage)  # To handle any ages outside the specified ranges, if any
  )) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(average = mean(average, na.rm = TRUE))

# Create a graph comparing the two age groups
ggplot(data_grouped, aes(x = age_group, y = average, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(x = "Age Group", y = "Average") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

@fig-5 separates the average data based on age group. Ages were split directly down the middle, and were based not on the total range of ages but rather the total amount of selfage variables we had in our sample (approximately 60 aggregate selfage data points). We fine, interestingly, that despite the model being unable to predict the latter half of ages in @fig-4, the model's accuracy holds up through clustering.

Our model in Section 2.4 finds a strong negative correlation with the selfage and average variables. Splitting our selfage variable into two, between low and high, manages to hold this correlation between the two groups. The higher age group, 44-100, is notably lower (by about .5) than the lower age group of 14-43.

This speaks to the strength of our model: despite a semi-arbitrary clustering of our selfage variable we fine the same correlation between the two groups as our model does between the two variables altogether.

Discussion

Significance of Findings

The significance of this paper's findings lies less in the trends found in the opinions of the sex acts themselves but rather in meta-analysis of the how the collection practices affected the data. Aella's dataset does many things well: it is robust, includes identifiers to separate sets of responses, and has an original sample size of over 48,000 individual responses. Based on these factors alone, we'd expect the data to be incredibly insightful with broad application to cultural opinions of various taboo sex acts.

However, the data has a built-in poison pill: a distinct and pervasive lack of any controls. This is most clear in @fig-1 and @fig-4, where our data models very neatly until we reach age groups of low distribution as seen in @fig-2. Even through eye-balling the data, based on X's average user group (where the survey was disseminated) it becomes incredibly unlikely that there are as many respondents in the 70-100 age group.

This lack of control stems from Aella's preferred survey medium alongside how she distributes the survey in the first place. Aella utilizes Google Forms; inherently, there is nothing wrong with this. However, Aella uses no function to ensure the responses are genuine or authenticated; there is no use of email validation, date of birth proof, or even something as simple as name validation through the form. All of these functions are possible through Google Forms, but require manual review from Aella herself. Whether this comes from laziness or simply lacking the need for it for her purposes can be debated ad nauseum, but fact remains that the lack of controls present in the survey allow for bad actors to poison the data as a whole. There's no way to distinguish which specific data-points are "bad", despite having overwhelming indication to there being so as @fig-4 shows. 

Furthermore, the data is inherently biased due to how Aella distributed the survey. Aella is an X influencer and the majority of her public communication comes from the social media platform. Because of this, it was natural that she found respondents by announcing it through the platform. As Aella's audience are a subset of X users, who are a subset of the general population, Aella's data has an inherent bias in who is responding to this survey. This isn't bad, per say, but results in limited application of the dataset beyond Aella's X followers who likely share certain "edgy" opinions on sex as she does. For example, the bestiality variable which tracks opinion of the crime of bestiality is not the highest taboo score of five in @fig-3; rather, it falls in a range of four to five on the taboo scale. Aella is known for controversial opinions on the subject of bestiality (CITE), which would explain why bestiality has a substantial proportion of lower taboo ratings than other sexual crimes like pedophilia on the heatmap. This shows how Aella's sampling created a skew which might not be accurate to the general population.

Importance of Good Collection Practices

Good collection is the backbone of good data. The US General Social Survey, for example, despite its weaknesses (CITE), has extremely strong and consistent data collection practices. Despite the inconvenience, especially in a connected age, the GSS is collected mostly through in person interviews.

The benefits of this are widespread, but primarily lie in the authenticity of the data. In person surveys allow for identifiers to be validated on the spot; this means that data like age and gender can be verified immediately which lends credibility to the responses collected by the survey. Does this prevent specific actors from lying regardless? No, but anecdotally we can assume that individuals who agree to an in-person survey, validate their information, and actively participate in the survey will be answering honestly and in good faith.

This contrasts with Aella's collection drastically. Once again, Aella collected this dataset through anonymous surveys distributed through X, a platform known for having a veritably high amount of bad actors and trolls (CITE). While functional for Aella's purposes, its not difficult to see how flawed her collection practices are. Instituting any number of simple controls would change this dramatically, but due to there not being any Aella's practices end up highlighting how much better other social opinion surveys are conducted.  

Conclusion

In conclusion, Aella's Kink Taboo Rating (v3) dataset provides an extremely robust dataset that is functionally useless. Very pretty graphs can be created with very interesting data points being plotted - this is an objective strength to Aella's reach and approach to data collection. However, to only praise her data based on how attractive/interesting the data is would be narrow minded.

For every strength this dataset has, a glaring flaw will undermine it. The data is collected with a "quick and dirty" approach, seeming to focus on amount of respondents over verifiable, authentic responses. Here lies the underlying question: is data really meaningful if we can't apply it generally? If I go to the fictional "Pee-In-Milkshake Convention", and I sample how many people enjoy pee in their milkshakes, I will likely get a high amount of responses indicating enjoyment of pee milkshakes. However interesting this data might be it is functionally useless - if I try to apply it any population outside of the milkshake pee enthusiasts I would be incredibly dishonest.

Therein lies the flaw in Aella's data: despite being robust on paper, her sampling and authenticity controls make her data useless. And useless data, no matter how interesting, shouldn't be used to glean useful insights to our culture. Unfortunately, this isn't the case with Aella's data: many other influencers and prominent tech industrialist treat her data as a socially valuable (CITE), where we can glean important insights to how we view sex acts. This is misguided and dangerous, and highlighting these bad practices by analyzing the data independently is how can push against misleading and dangerous data being disseminated.

Introduction to the Analysis of Aella's Kink Taboo Rating Survey

In the digital age, the proliferation of online data collection tools has vastly expanded our capacity to gather information on sensitive topics, such as sexual attitudes and behaviors. This paper delves into a dataset originally collected by internet influencer Aella through a Google Forms survey, primarily disseminated via the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Aella's dataset, hosting responses to various sexual acts deemed taboo, provides a unique lens into the sexual mores of a specific segment of the internet-using public. However, the uncontrolled nature of this data collection raises significant questions about the generalizability and reliability of the insights derived from it.

The primary focus of this paper is to analyze the impact of age on perceptions of sexual taboos. Initial inspection of the raw data, comprising over 48,000 responses, revealed a significant volume of unusable data due to missing age identifiers, prompting a rigorous cleaning process. Ultimately, the analysis was conducted on a refined dataset of approximately 3,800 responses, segmented by respondents' self-reported age. This cleaned dataset was then used to create a model to explore how perceptions of taboo vary across age groups.

Our analysis identified a clear, statistically significant trend: as age increases, the average taboo rating assigned to various sexual acts decreases. This relationship is quantified in our linear regression model, which captures a notable proportion of the variance in responses based on age alone. The implications of this finding are profound, suggesting a potential shift in sexual norms over generations, or perhaps a reflection of the more liberal attitudes held by younger internet users.

Moreover, the structure of this paper is designed to guide the reader through our comprehensive methodology, from data collection and cleaning to detailed statistical analysis and model building. Each section is crafted to build upon the last, culminating in a discussion that contextualizes our findings within the broader sociocultural and methodological landscape.

By dissecting the method of data collection used by Aella and critically assessing its impacts on the data quality and analysis outcomes, this paper not only provides insights into sexual norms but also underscores the crucial importance of rigorous data collection methodologies in social research. Through this dual lens, we aim to contribute both to the academic field of sexual behavior studies and to the evolving discussion on best practices in online survey research.

Give this paper an abstract following this structure faithfully (NO MORE THAN 4 SENTENCES!):

Four variables acquired from the US social survey were analyzed and cross-references accross decades in order to gauge general opinion around common sexual practices. Analysis confirms an overall trend of liberalization but also notes unusual conservative skews with certain variables. Findings also indicate a need to review data collection practices. Future analysis of the same variables is recommended following an overhaul of data collection practices for an increasingly online culture.
ChatGPT
Data from a survey conducted by internet influencer Aella on taboo sexual attitudes was analyzed to examine the influence of age on perceptions of various sexual acts. The analysis revealed a significant trend indicating that younger individuals tend to rate sexual acts as less taboo compared to older respondents, suggesting a liberal shift in sexual norms among younger demographics. However, the study highlighted substantial issues with data collection methods, including a lack of controls and potential response biases, which may skew results. It is recommended that future research on similar topics implement more rigorous data collection frameworks, particularly adapted for online environments, to ensure broader applicability and accuracy.

Beveridge titled "The General Social Survey and Its Impact in Sociology and Other Social Sciences" from 2007, you would use the @misc BibTeX entry if there's no specific format for technical reports or white papers that fits better in your citation style. Here's how you can structure this citation in BibTeX format:

bibtex
Copy code
@misc{beveridge2007gss,
  author = {Andrew A. Beveridge},
  title = {The General Social Survey and Its Impact in Sociology and Other Social Sciences},
  year = {2007},
  howpublished = {\url{https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2007/nsf0748/nsf0748_6.pdf}},
  note = {Accessed: Date of Access}
}
Explanation:
@misc: This type is used for sources that do not fit into other more specific categories, perfect for documents like PDFs from websites.
author: Lists the author of the document. For multiple authors, separate them with and, using the format Last, First.
title: The title of the document as it appears on the title page or in the metadata of the PDF.

Go all the way back to the original raw csv. Simulate what the cleaned data would look like based on the raw
ChatGPT
To simulate what the cleaned data would look like based on the original raw CSV you've mentioned, let's assume the cleaning steps you specified earlier were applied. I'll describe the process and simulate a small example of what the data might look like after cleaning.

Assumptions for Cleaning:
Remove Specific Metadata Columns: Such as "User", "Run", "Program Version", etc., which are typically not relevant for analytical purposes.
Remove Columns with Bracketed Codes: These often represent survey-specific metadata that may not be useful for broader analysis.
Filter Out Rows with NA in 'selfage': Ensuring the dataset only contains entries where age is specified.
Remove any other unnecessary columns: Like those related to session duration or internal tracking.
Simulating the Cleaning Process:
Assume we start with a CSV file that looks something like this (simplified):

User	Run	Program Version	Time Started	Selfage	ArousalScale	Your age? (rkkox57)	Which category? (4790ydl)	normalsex	analsex
1	1	1.0	12:00	25	5	25	Category1	3	2
2	1	1.0	12:05	NA	4	NA	Category2	2	4
3	1	1.0	12:10	30	3	30	Category1	4	5
Steps:
Remove specified columns: "User", "Run", "Program Version", "Time Started", "ArousalScale", "Your age? (rkkox57)", "Which category? (4790ydl)".
Filter out rows where 'Selfage' is NA.
Resulting Cleaned Data:
After applying the cleaning steps, the data might look like this:

Selfage	normalsex	analsex
25	3	2
30	4	5
Python Simulation:
Here's a brief Python script simulating this cleaning process (assuming you might be interested in how this could be programmatically done in a language like Python for conceptual understanding):

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO

# Simulating reading from a CSV
data = StringIO("""
User,Run,Program Version,Time Started,Selfage,ArousalScale,Your age? (rkkox57),Which category? (4790ydl),normalsex,analsex
1,1,1.0,12:00,25,5,25,Category1,3,2

Generate R script to simulate what our dataset would look like based on the CSV. For example, have columns for age, gender, and some randomized sexual acts with a number from 0-5
ChatGPT
To simulate a dataset in R that resembles a cleaned version of the CSV with columns for age, gender, and randomized scores for several sexual acts, we can use the data.frame function along with some random data generation functions from R. Here’s a script that sets up such a dataset:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Set a seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Create a data frame
data <- data.frame(
  age = sample(18:70, 100, replace = TRUE),  # Random ages between 18 and 70
  gender = sample(c("Male", "Female", "Other"), 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.48, 0.48, 0.04)),  # Gender with a given probability
  normalsex = sample(0:5, 100, replace = TRUE),  # Random scores for 'normalsex'
  analsex = sample(0:5, 100, replace = TRUE),    # Random scores for 'analsex'
  groupsex = sample(0:5, 100, replace = TRUE)    # Random scores for 'groupsex'
)

# Print the first few rows of the dataset to see what it looks like
print(head(data))

# Optional: Save the simulated data to a CSV file
write.csv(data, "simulated_sexual_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
Explanation of the Script:
Libraries: The dplyr library is loaded for potential data manipulation tasks, though it's not strictly necessary for this particular script.
Random Seed: Setting a seed ensures that the random numbers generated can be reproduced exactly in future runs.
Data Generation:
age: Randomly generates ages between 18 and 70 for 100 respondents.
gender: Randomly assigns a gender with the probabilities roughly balanced between Male and Female, and a smaller probability for Other.
normalsex, analsex, groupsex: Randomly generates scores from 0 to 5 for different sexual acts. These represent how taboo or acceptable respondents might find these acts, with 0 being not taboo at all and 5 being extremely taboo.
Viewing Data: head(data) prints the first few rows of the created data frame to the console, so you can quickly check the outcome.
Saving the Data: The last line of the script saves the simulated data to a CSV file named "simulated_sexual_data.csv". This line can be commented out if you do not wish to save the file.
This R script effectively creates a synthetic dataset that could be used for testing analysis workflows, making assumptions about distributions, and handling data similar to what might be expected from a real survey dataset.

Generate R script for 4, simple tests on the files taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet and taboo-average-agescore.parquet
ChatGPT
To perform simple tests on two parquet files, taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet and taboo-average-agescore.parquet, using R, we can create a script that includes basic data checks and statistical tests. These tests can include checking the structure of the data, summarizing the datasets, performing a basic correlation test, and generating a simple linear model.

Here's an R script that outlines these steps:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(arrow)

# Read the cleaned datasets
ratings_data <- read_parquet("taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")
average_data <- read_parquet("taboo-average-agescore.parquet")

# 1. Structure and Summary of the datasets
# Check the structure
str(ratings_data)
str(average_data)

# Generate summary statistics for both datasets
summary(ratings_data)
summary(average_data)

# 2. Basic Correlation Test between two variables (assuming both datasets have common variables)
# For example, checking correlation between 'normalsex' and 'analsex' ratings in the ratings_data
correlation_test <- cor(ratings_data$normalsex, ratings_data$analsex, use = "complete.obs")
print(paste("Correlation between normalsex and analsex: ", correlation_test))

# 3. Simple Linear Regression Model
# Assuming 'average_data' contains 'selfage' and 'average' where 'average' is the mean scores for 'selfage'
# Fit a linear model
model <- lm(average ~ selfage, data = average_data)
summary(model)

# 4. Plot the data with the linear model fit
ggplot(average_data, aes(x = selfage, y = average)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Linear Model Fit: Average Score by Age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Average Score") +
  theme_minimal()

# Optionally, you might want to save the plot to a file
ggsave("linear_model_fit.png", width = 8, height = 6)

# Output results
print("Structures and summaries checked.")
print("Correlation and linear model analysis completed.")
Explanation of the Script:
Libraries: Loads necessary R packages. arrow for reading parquet files, dplyr for data manipulation, ggplot2 for plotting, and readr which might be needed for other data reading tasks.
Reading Data: Reads the two Parquet files into R.
Structure and Summary: Uses str() to show the structure and summary() to provide descriptive statistics of the datasets.
Correlation Test: Calculates the correlation between two variables, assuming they exist in ratings_data. This is a simple check of how two ratings might be related.
Linear Regression Model: Fits a linear regression model to explore the relationship between age and average scores in average_data.
Plotting: Visualizes the relationship along with the linear model fit.
Saving the Plot: Uses ggsave to save the generated plot to a file.
Output Statements: Prints confirmation that tests and analyses have been completed.
This script provides a comprehensive approach to conducting initial tests and analyses on the specified datasets, which are important steps in data analysis pipelines.

Tests 2 and 3 should be simpler, and both parquet files should be tested independently of eachother
ChatGPT
If you're looking for simpler tests that apply independently to each Parquet file without relying on the presence of the same variables in both, you can focus on basic integrity checks and simple data summarizations. Here’s how you can modify the R script to perform simple and independent tests on both taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet and taboo-average-agescore.parquet:

R Script:
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the cleaned datasets
ratings_data <- read_parquet("taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")
average_data <- read_parquet("taboo-average-agescore.parquet")

# 1. Check structure and summarize the datasets
# Print structure
print("Structure of Ratings Data:")
str(ratings_data)
print("Structure of Average Data:")
str(average_data)

# Print summary statistics
print("Summary of Ratings Data:")
summary(ratings_data)
print("Summary of Average Data:")
summary(average_data)

# 2. Simple data integrity check - count NA values in each dataset
na_count_ratings <- sum(is.na(ratings_data))
na_count_average <- sum(is.na(average_data))

print(paste("Total NA values in Ratings Data: ", na_count_ratings))
print(paste("Total NA values in Average Data: ", na_count_average))

# 3. Visualize distribution of a key variable in each dataset if applicable
# For Ratings Data (assuming it has a variable like 'normalsex')
if("normalsex" %in% names(ratings_data)) {
  ggplot(ratings_data, aes(x = normalsex)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "blue") +
    labs(title = "Distribution of 'Normalsex' Ratings", x = "Rating", y = "Frequency") +
    theme_minimal()
}

# For Average Data (assuming it has 'average' related to 'selfage')
if("average" %in% names(average_data)) {
  ggplot(average_data, aes(x = average)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "green") +
    labs(title = "Distribution of Average Scores by Age", x = "Average Score", y = "Frequency") +
    theme_minimal()
}

# Output results
print("Data integrity and distributions visualized.")
Explanation of the Updated Script:
Structure and Summary: This part remains the same, providing a quick overview of the data structure and summarizing key statistics, which are fundamental steps to understand any dataset.
Simple Data Integrity Test: This test counts the number of NA values in each dataset. This is a straightforward measure of data completeness.
Visualization of Data Distribution: Histograms for a key variable from each dataset are generated (assuming these variables exist). This test provides a visual understanding of the distribution of responses, which is crucial for identifying data patterns or potential outliers.
Conditional Checks: Before plotting, the script checks if the key variable exists in the dataset. This ensures that the script does not fail if the dataset structure changes or the expected variable is absent.
By focusing on these simpler and independent tests for each dataset, you can quickly gauge the quality and characteristics of your data without complex dependencies or analyses. This approach is particularly useful in the early stages of data exploration and cleaning.

Add a 4th test
ChatGPT
For the fourth test, let's incorporate a basic statistical test that can be applied independently to each dataset. Given that the taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet may have multiple variables representing ratings of different sexual acts, we could test for normality on one of these variables to help inform the assumptions for later statistical analysis. For the taboo-average-agescore.parquet, we could check if average scores follow a normal distribution, which might be important for certain types of analyses like parametric testing.

R Script with the 4th Test:
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(nortest)  # For normality test

# Read the cleaned datasets
ratings_data <- read_parquet("taboo-ratings-cleaned.parquet")
average_data <- read_parquet("taboo-average-agescore.parquet")

# 1. Check structure and summarize the datasets
print("Structure of Ratings Data:")
str(ratings_data)
print("Structure of Average Data:")
str(average_data)

# Print summary statistics
print("Summary of Ratings Data:")
summary(ratings_data)
print("Summary of Average Data:")
summary(average_data)

# 2. Simple data integrity check - count NA values in each dataset
na_count_ratings <- sum(is.na(ratings_data))
na_count_average <- sum(is.na(average_data))

print(paste("Total NA values in Ratings Data: ", na_count_ratings))
print(paste("Total NA values in Average Data: ", na_count_average))

# 3. Visualize distribution of a key variable in each dataset if applicable
# For Ratings Data (assuming it has a variable like 'normalsex')
if("normalsex" %in% names(ratings_data)) {
  ggplot(ratings_data, aes(x = normalsex)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "blue") +
    labs(title = "Distribution of 'Normalsex' Ratings", x = "Rating", y = "Frequency") +
    theme_minimal()
}

# For Average Data (assuming it has 'average' related to 'selfage')
if("average" %in% names(average_data)) {
  ggplot(average_data, aes(x = average)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "green") +
    labs(title = "Distribution of Average Scores by Age", x = "Average Score", y = "Frequency") +
    theme_minimal()
}

# 4. Normality Test for a key variable in each dataset
# For Ratings Data (assuming it has 'normalsex')
if("normalsex" %in% names(ratings_data)) {
  normalsex_p_value <- ad.test(ratings_data$normalsex, na.action = na.omit)$p.value
  print(paste("Anderson-Darling test p-value for 'normalsex':", normalsex_p_value))
}

# For Average Data (assuming it has 'average')
if("average" %in% names(average_data)) {
  average_p_value <- ad.test(average_data$average, na.action = na.omit)$p.value
  print(paste("Anderson-Darling test p-value for 'average':", average_p_value))
}

# Output results
print("Data integrity, distributions, and normality tests completed.")
Explanation of the 4th Test:
Normality Test: Uses the Anderson-Darling test from the nortest package to check if the selected variables ('normalsex' from ratings data and 'average' from average data) are normally distributed. This is crucial for determining the appropriate statistical methods for further analysis.
Conditional Execution: Each test is wrapped in a conditional statement to ensure it only runs if the variable exists in the dataset, preventing errors if data structure changes.
This setup ensures robust initial data checks, which are essential for guiding further detailed analysis and ensuring that the underlying assumptions of statistical tests are met.
